# Yewno_Data_Challenge

Develop a system for plagiarism detection: you are given a set of textual documents and you
are asked to detect which documents contain significant overlapping in content. It is up to you to
define what "significant" and "overlapping" mean. You can also use examples of plagiarized
portions of documents.
