Abstract.

A novel hybrid data-driven approach is developed for forecasting power system para-
meters with the goal of increasing the eﬃciency of short-term forecasting studies for
non-stationary time-series. The proposed approach is based on mode decomposition and
a feature analysis of initial retrospective data using the Hilbert-Huang transform and
machine learning algorithms. The random forests and gradient boosting trees learning
techniques were examined. The decision tree techniques were used to rank the importance
of variables employed in the forecasting models. The Mean Decrease Gini index is employed
as an impurity function. The resulting hybrid forecasting models employ the radial basis
function neural network and support vector regression.

Apart from introduction and references the paper is organized as follows. The second
section presents the background and the review of several approaches for short-term
forecasting of power system parameters. In the third section a hybrid machine learning-
based algorithm using Hilbert-Huang transform is developed for short-term forecasting of
power system parameters. Fourth section describes the decision tree learning algorithms
used for the issue of variables importance. Finally in section six the experimental results
in the following electric power problems are presented: active power ﬂow forecasting,
electricity price forecasting and for the wind speed and direction forecasting.

Keywords: time series, forecasting, integral transforms, ANN, SVM, machine learning,
boosting, singular integral, feature analysis.

Introduction

In recent years power industries worldwide have experienced two major
changes: liberalization of the electricity market and the expansion of renew-
able energy. Liberalization has led to a tremendous increase in the inter-
regional wholesale electricity trade between neighboring utilities or regions.
The increasing penetration of renewable energy has led to increasing depen-
dency on the volatile nature of renewable energy sources. Because of this,
changes in a power system’s parameters often feature a sharply variable
non-stationary behavior, which limits the eﬃciency of modern technologies
for forecasting time series [23, 29].

In this situation, eﬀective short-term forecasting of state variables is
highly important for market participants in wholesale power markets and for
the power system as a whole. Over the past decade, many power engineers
have focused their eﬀorts on novel prediction problems, especially short-
term forecasting of power ﬂow, wind power forecasting and electricity price
forecasting. In addition to diﬃculties with the sharply variable non-stationary
behavior of power system parameters, researchers deal with a data requireпїЅ-
ments problem in actual forecasting of such parameters. The required histori-
cal data is either not publicly available on power companies’ websites or
only made available with some delay. Consequently, the correct pattern
of possible future variability of power system parameters is diﬃcult to
eﬀectively identify, which in turn prevents accurate forecasting of system
variables.

In this paper a novel hybrid approach for power system parameters
forecasting is suggested, which combines the eﬀective apparatus of analysis
of non-stationary time series – the Hilbert-Huang integral transform (HHT)
and machine learning technologies.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the background and
the review of several approaches for short-term forecasting of power system
parameters. In section 3 a hybrid machine learning-based algorithm using
HHT is developed for short-term forecasting of power system parameters.
Section 4 presents the experimental results and discussion.

2. Background

In the electricity grid at any moment balance must be maintained between
electricity consumption and generation - otherwise disturbances in power
quality or supply may occur. Forecasting power systems parameters may be
considered at diﬀerent time scales, depending on the intended application.
From milliseconds up to a few minutes, forecasts can be used, for instance,
for turbine active control. This type of forecast is usually referred to as very

ISU-2013-PL06042014.tex; 10/04/2014; 0:26; p.2

Power System Parameters Forecasting

short-term forecasts. For the following 48–72 hours, forecasts are needed for
power system management or energy trading.

The short-term forecasting of power system parameters can be carried
out both with the aid of classical approaches of dynamic estimation, statisti-
cal methods of analysis of time series and regressive models, and with the
aid of artiﬁcial intelligence. Many techniques have been employed for such
purposes, including machine learning techniques – artiﬁcial neural networks
(ANNs) [12, 10], support vector machines (SVMs) [8], random forest models
[8, 22] and etc. Moreover, time series models, like ARIMA, GARCH models
[13, 11], Kalman ﬁlter-based algorithm [9, 30] have also been proven to be
eﬀective in the power system parameters forecasting.

It is worth noting that power systems parameters often feature sharply
variable non-stationary behaviour, which limits the eﬃciency of the stated
technologies for forecasting of time series. Studies have shown that hybrid
approaches, that is a combination of diﬀerent intelligent techniques, have
great potential and are worth pursuing [29]. Previously, several hybrid fore-
casting approaches have been proposed, including ARIMA-ANN models
[1], Fuzzy-ANN-based models [14], Wavelet-ANN-based models [26], Fuzzy-
expert system-based models [4] among others [6]. For review and biblio-
graphy of the state-ofthe-art medods for dynamical systems identiﬁcation
and forecasting readers may refer to the monograph [27].

It is well known that for eﬀective forecasting of power system parameters
a number of additional, correlated characteristics must be taken into account,
which can be inﬂuenced by a predictable parameter. For instance, everything
from salmon migration to forest ﬁres can aﬀect current and future electricity
prices. But quite often, information about these characteristics is either
unavailable or limited and contradictory. As a result, scientiﬁc researchers
and power engineers have to work with only one retrospective predictable
parameter time series without additional characteristics, which imposes
limitations on forecasting performance. We consider that, in such a case,
forecasting performance can be improved by using a transition from a time
series task to a regression task, when an initial time series is decomposed into
some components. An investigation of properties of obtained components
can help to improve the performance of a power system parameter forecast.

3. Proposed Approach

We propose a hybrid machine learning-based algorithm using HHT as a data
preprocessing technology [16, 17]. Figure 1 the shows general forecasting
scheme. There are ﬁve main blocks.

Data collection is performed by the SCADA system, which merely identi-
ﬁes a set of power system parameters. The second block preprocesses input
data with HHT. HHT is a two-step algorithm; combining empirical mode

decomposition (EMD) and the Hilbert transform (HT). After the HHT
was employed we obtain, through EMD and HT, the sets of intrinsic mode
functions (IMFs), instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies. These sets are
used as input values to the next block for feature selection and dimensionality
reduction. In this block, learning methods are used – Random Forest (RF)
and Boosting Trees (BT) to rank a variable’s importance [7, 3]. SVM and
ANN forecasting models with non-linear optimization algorithms are employed
in the next block for optimal selection of parameters. The last block is used
for testing and a comparison of obtained forecasting models. As a result,
an HHT-ANN-SVM-based forecasting system will be able to predict power
system parameters.

The main goal of the hybrid forecasting approach development was to
increase the eﬃciency of forecasting studies, when we deal with limited
retrospective data and sharply variable, non-stationary time series of power
system parameters.

4. Decision tree learning algorithms for the issue of variables

importance

Forecasting of wind power, power ﬂows, energy price etc. have become a
major issue in power systems. Following the needs of today’s competitive
environment, various techniques are used to forecast wind power, energy
price and power demand. Over the past decade, diﬀerent machine learning

Power System Parameters Forecasting

algorithms have been investigated for analyzing power systems parameters’
patterns in order to obtain forecasts in power systems with high accuracy.
The importance of a variable is the contribution it makes to the success of
the model. For a predictive model, success means good forecasting. Often the
forecasting relies mainly on a few variables. A good measure of importance
reveals those variables. The better the forecasting, the closer the model
represents reality, and the more plausible it is that the important variables
represent the true cause of forecasting.

We used the decision tree techniques to rank the importance of variables.
These algorithms can output a list of predictor variables that they believe
to be important in predicting the outcome. If nothing else, researchers can
identify a subset of the data to only include the most “important” variables,
and use that with another model.

As it is explained in [19], every binary decision tree is separately represented

by a tree structure T, from an input vector (X1, ..., Xp) taking its values in
(χ1 ∗...∗χp = χ) to a output variable y ∈ Y . Every certain node t represents
a subset of the space χ, with the root node being χ itself. Construction of
decision trees usually works top-down, by choosing a variable at each step
that splits the set of items by the binary test st = (Xm < c). The internal
node t divides its subset into two subsets1 corresponding to two children
nodes tL and tR. For a new instance the predicted value ˆY is the label of
the leaf reached by the instance when it is propagated through the tree.
Algorithms for constructing decision trees identify at each node t the split
st = s∗ for which the partition of the Nt node samples into tL and tR
maximizes the decrease

∆i(s, t) = i(t) − pLi(tL) − pRi(tR)

With regard to variable importance in Random forests, in [3] it was proposed
to add up the weighted impurity (loss) decreases p(t)i(st, t) for all nodes t
where Xm is used, averaged over all NT trees in the forest:

Imp(Xm) =

1

N tXT XtǫT :ν(st)=Xm

p(t)i(st, t)

and where p(t) is the proportion Nt
variable which is used in split st.

N of samples reaching t and ν(st) is a

In our paper we have examined two decision tree learning techniques:
random forests and gradient boosting trees. We used the decision tree
techniques to rank the importance of variables. Also we use Gini index,
which is also called Mean Decrease Gini, as an impurity function. It was
introduced for decision trees in [2] and later modiﬁed for gradient boosting
machines [5].

1 More generally, splits are deﬁned by a (not necessarily binary) partition of the range

χm of possible values of a single variable χm

5. Case Study

The novel hybrid approach is realized in STATISTICA 6.0. and Matlab. The
eﬃciency of the developed approach is demonstrated with real time series in
the following electric power problems: active power ﬂow forecasting for the
Western Baikal-Amur Mainline (Russia) [16, 15], electricity price forecasting
for the Australian and Nord Pool Spot (EU) power markets [17], wind speed
forecasting for the Valentia region (Ireland) [30].

5.1. Valentia wind speed forecasting (Ireland)

5.1.0.1. HHT-ANN-SVM model The initial training data is represented
by two per-hour time-series: wind speed and wind direction values for 1
year for the Valentia region. Both time series were decomposed into IMFs
by the Huang method, and the Hilbert transform was employed to obtain
the amplitudes, A and frequency, F . The latter along with these HHT
components were used as input values of the selected HHT-ANN and HHT-
SVM models. The ﬁnal 48 hours of the data were reserved for calculating
performance statistics.

Fig. 2 illustrates the feature selection analysis of the modiﬁed Valentia
wind speed data using regression machine learning algorithms – Boosting
Trees and Random Forest. As seen, high-frequency components of the initial
wind speed data (IMF1, IMF2, A1, A2 and F1, F2) have less predictive
importance (less than 0.3) by comparison with other components, and
therefore they can be excluded from the trained data.

As a result, the following hybrid models are constructed, trained and

tested: a RBF neural network (HHT-ANN model) and epsilon-SVM regression
model (HHT-SVM model). The RBF network is trained by a 2-Phase-RBF
scheme (two-step algorithm). After a training-testing process we obtained

the following errors: train error – 0.251%, validation error – 0.263% and test
error – 0.257%. The obtained RBF network had the following structure:
input neurons 25, hidden neurons 162 and output neuron 1.

The polynomial kernel function is used in the epsilon-SVM regression
model. Let us brieﬂy outline the SVM regression model. Let (xi, yi), i =

1, N , be the input data, namely xi ∈ eX ⊂ X, yi ∈ eY ⊂ Y, X is the set of

input data, Y is the set of values of the desired objective function. SVM
resolves the regression problem by estimation of the unknown function

yi = f (xi) + εi,

(1)

where εi is error of i-th observation, e.g. in linear case f (x) = hw, xi + b,
where w ∈ Rn are weights and b ∈ R is the oﬀset parameter. In nonlinear
case SVM employs φ : Rn → H and instead of (1) the following function f is
under the estimation f (x) = hw, φ(x)i + b. Determination of parameters is
reduced to a convex optimization problem, i.e. the the following regularized
risk functional minimization

term in the functional (2) penalizes any deviation f (xi) from yi based on
the constraints (3). This problem is resolved in terms of the dual problem

represented as follows K(xi, x) = hφ(xi), φ(x)i , which is the RBF is our
case. Using a 10-fold cross-validation method the following optimal training
constants and RBF kernel parameters were determined: the capacity constant
C = 1; ε = 1.3; d = 3;γ = 0.03.

5.1.0.2. FF-ANN-SA model
In this case example a feed forward ANN
is tested for performance comparison with the hybrid HHT approach. The
candidate input vectors for the FF-ANN-SA model were: the current value
of wind speed at time t; previous values of wind speeds at times (t − 1),
(t − 3), (t − 6); wind direction at times t and (t − 1); and time of day. All
input vectors and the target vector were normalized to the range [0, 1], and

the data were divided in the ratio 4:1 between training and validation sets,
with the ﬁnal 48 hours reserved for testing as before.

A hybrid simulated annealing/tabu search algorithm for simultaneous
optimization of the network structure and weights was applied to the problem
of 24h ahead prediction of wind speeds [21, 22]. The structural optimization
element of the algorithm uses a network pruning approach, which involves
deﬁning an initial, maximal network and then randomly removing intra-
neuron connections until a more parsimonious network is arrived at (Fig.
3). The inter-neuron connectivity and weights were optimized using the
hybrid algorithm prior to subsequent optimization of weights and biases
using Levenberg-Marquadt backpropagation.

The maximal network was deﬁned as having all seven candidate inputs,
and a single hidden layer with nine neurons. Therefore, the maximum
number of inter-neuron connections was N1N2 + N2N3 where N1 is the
number of inputs, N2 the number of hidden layer neurons, and N3 the
number of outputs. The cost function speciﬁed for the optimization is based
on predictive performance and number of inter-neuron connections in the
network, with a 3:1 weighting ratio between network complexity and per-
formance. Tan-sigmoidal and linear activation functions were used for the
hidden and output layer neurons, respectively. The linear activation function
of the output layer was constrained to produce only positive outputs, in
order to represent the physical reality of wind speeds which are zero-limited.
The algorithm was allowed to run for a maximum of 25 iterations, or until
the GL5 early stopping criterion was satisﬁed [25]. In Table I and Figure 4
the testing results for a “24 hour ahead” wind speed forecasting are presented
based on the HHT –ANN, HHT–SVM and FF-ANN-SA models. As shown
in Table I, the most accurate forecast was given by the hybrid HHT-SVM
and HHT-ANN models (MAE for 0-24h period – 0.58 ms and 0.55 ms

The initial training data is represented by the telemetric data of the per-
minute active power ﬂow for 3 days (4320 values). The initial time series
were converted using the HHT algorithm. The obtained HHT components
are used as input values of the trained machine learning-based forecasting
models. The MLP neural network model is trained with the Broyden–
Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm [32]. The radial basis function kernel
function is used in the epsilon-SVM regression model. Using a 10-fold cross-
validation method the following optimal training constants and kernel para-
meters were determined: the capacity constant, C = 10; epsilon, ε = 0.4;
degree, γ = 0.001. To compare the performance of forecasting approaches,
the authors also calculated similar forecasts based on conventional ap-
proaches: Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), single ANN
and Multiplicative Exponential Smoothing.

Table II and Fig. 5 summaries the numerical results for a “1 minute
ahead” active power ﬂow forecasting on based on the HHT-ANN and HHT-
SVM models. As Table II shows, the most accurate forecast was given by
the hybrid HHT- SVM and HHT-ANN models (MAPE - 11.6% and 12.5%
respectively), compared with the conventional approaches: the ANN model
– 15,8%, the ARIMA model – 22.4 % and Exponential Smoothing – 32.2%.

5.3. Electricity price forecasting for the Australian

market (Australia)

The Australian NEM is a duopoly with a dominant player, resulting in
electricity price changes associated with the behavior of dominant players,
and is very diﬃcult to predict in the short term. To assess the forecasting
performance of diﬀerent models, each dataset is divided into two samples
for training and testing. The training dataset is used exclusively for model
development, and then the test sample is used to evaluate the established
model. To build the forecasting model for each of the considered weeks, the
information available includes hourly price historical data of the four weeks
prior to the ﬁrst day of the week whose prices are to be predicted.

Here we present the comparison of forecast performance with the hybrid
ARIMA-ANN model proposed by Phatchakorn Areekul et al. in [1] and our
HHT-ANN hybrid using the data of Australian national electricity market,
New South Wales. By analogy with [1] for the sake of a fair comparison, the
fourth week in one season is selected.

The RF-BT-based importance analysis is shown that in contrast to pre-
vious results, in this case study, two ﬁrst high-frequency components of
electricity price data IMF1 (BT – 1.0, RF – 0,79) and IMF2 (BT – 0.95,
RF – 0,70) have high prediction importance. Components IMF5 and F2
have less prediction importance (less than 0.20) and therefore they can be
excluded from the trained data.

Table III and Figure 6 present the values of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE
from the price forecasting performance of the proposed hybrid HHT-ANN-
SVM model and hybrid ARIMA-ANN model. The results demonstrate that
the proposed HHT-ANN (MAPE – 12.24%) hybrid model could provide

comparing to the ARIMA-ANN – 13.03% and the HHT-SVM – 17.16%

to the ARIMA-ANN model (7.12% and 28.02%).

6. Conclusions

In this paper we studied the problem of short-term forecasting of power
system parameters. The main contribution is the hybrid machine learning-
based algorithm using HHT as a data preprocessing technology. The proposed

approach is based on mode decomposition and a feature analysis of initial
retrospective data using HHT and BT-RF-based machine learning algorithms
for a prediction importance evaluation. We employed machine learning tech-
nologies such as ANNs and SVM as forecasting models.

Forecast performance comparison studies with other conventional, machine

learning and hybrid approaches were also presented, especially with the
FF-ANN-SA approach. The hybrid ANN-SA optimization method does not
approach the performance of the HHT methods, as indicated by higher
RMSE and MAE. Performance of the hybrid optimization ANN method can
probably be improved with some further adjustments, but it is not expected
that it will approach the performance of the superior HHT methods due to
the non-stationarity of the wind speed time series. Also one more circumstance
should be noted. As for today there are a lot of results in the HHT time
series processing ﬁeld which are associated with various modiﬁcations of the
HHT. In [31], a modiﬁcation of the standard approach to the decomposition
of IMF was suggested, and in [28] there is the variation of this proposed
modiﬁcation. Both of these approaches are based on the idea of adding
a white noise to the original signal and the construction of an ensemble of
diﬀerent sets of components. Averaging over the components of an ensemble
provides a set of IMF, which contains the components reﬂecting the real
components of the investigated process more accurately than the original
EMD. These modiﬁcations of the proposed hybrid machine learning-based
algorithm will be employed in our future works.
