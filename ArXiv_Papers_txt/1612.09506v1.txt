Abstract 

With rapid development of the Internet, the web contents 
become huge. Most of the websites are publicly available 
and  anyone  can  access  the  contents  everywhere  such  as 
workplace,  home  and  even  schools.  Nevertheless,  not  all 
the  web  contents  are  appropriate  for  all  users,  especially 
children. An example of these contents is pornography im-
ages  which  should  be  restricted  to  certain  age  group. 
Besides,  these  images  are  not  safe  for  work  (NSFW)  in 
which  employees  should  not  be  seen  accessing  such  con-
tents.  Recently,  convolutional  neural  networks  have  been 
successfully applied to many computer vision problems. In-
spired  by  these  successes,  we  propose  a  mixture  of 
convolutional  neural  networks  for  adult  content  recogni-
tion.  Unlike  other  works,  our  method  is  formulated  on  a 
weighted sum of multiple deep neural network models. The 
weights of each CNN models are expressed as a linear re-
gression  problem  learnt  using  Ordinary  Least  Squares 
(OLS). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 
model outperforms both single CNN model and the average 
sum of CNN models in adult content recognition. 

1.  Introduction 

The number of Internet users increases rapidly since the 
introduction  of  World  Wide  Web  (WWW)  in  1991.  With 
the growth of Internet users, the content of the Internet be-
comes huge. However, some contents such as adult content 
are not appropriate for all users. Filtering websites and re-
stricting  access  to  adult  images  are  important  problems 
which  researchers  have  been  trying  to  solve  for  decades. 
Different methods have been introduced to block or restrict 
access to adult  websites such as IP address blocking, text 
filtering, and image filtering. Internet Protocol (IP) address 
blocking bans the adult content from being accessed by cer-
tain users. This technique works by maintaining a list of IPs 
or  Domain  Name  Servers  (DNS)  addresses  of  such  non-
appropriate websites. For each request, an application agent 
compares the requested website IP address or DNS with the 
restricted  list.  The  request  is  denied  if  the  two  addresses 
match, and approved otherwise. This method requires man-
ual  keeping  and  maintenance  of  the  restricted  list  IPs, 
which is difficult as the number of the adult content web-
sites  grows  or  some  websites  change  their  addresses 
regularly.   

Filtering by text is the most popular method to block ac-
cess  to  adult  content  websites.  The  text  filtering  method 
blocks the access to a website if it contains at least one of 
the restricted  words. Another  method is to use a  machine 

learning algorithm to find the restricted words. Sometimes, 
instead of using the machine learning technique to extract 
keywords, a classification model is used directly to decide 
whether the requested webpage is safe [1]. Nonetheless, the 
text blocking method only understands texts and it cannot 
work with standalone images. This problem arises when the 
webpage does not contain the restricted keywords or does 
not  contain  text  at  all.  Worse  still,  it  may  block  safe 
webpages such as a  medical webpage as it contains some 
restricted keywords.   

Another  blocking  method  uses  image  filtering  [2]–[4]. 
This method works directly on the images, trying to detect 
if the image contains adult content. Detection directly from 
images is favorable as it does not require a list of IPs and is 
scalable to new websites; and is not sensitive to certain key-
words.  However,  detecting  adult  content  from  images 
requires a complex model as the images have different illu-
minations, positions, backgrounds, resolutions or poses. In 
addition, the image may contain part of the human body, or 
the person in the image may be partially dressed. 

  In this paper, we seek to automatically recognize adult 
content from images using a mixture of convolutional neu-
ral networks (CNNs). Figure 1 shows the architecture of the 
proposed model in which eight CNNs models, followed by 
Fully Connected (FC) layers, are used to vote for the possi-
ble class of  the image. Each  model conforms to  the same 
architecture  with  different  weights  computed  using  Ordi-
nary Least Square (OLS). Usually, the training time of the 
deep  CNN  is  very  long.  We  present  a  solution  to  create 
eight models from a single architecture during training. A 
checkpoint  is  set  to  identify  and  pick  the  eight  most-per-
forming  models  during  the  training  session.  The  solution 
selects  the  most  optimal  model  to  improve  accuracy,  and 
helps reduce the training time drastically.   

The  contributions  of  this  paper  are  as  follows:  1)  con-
structing a mixture of multiple deep CNNs at no extra cost; 
2) assigning different weights to every model by applying 
OLS on all the model's output predictions 

2.  Related work 

The methods of recognizing adult content images can be 
divided  into  four  categories:  color-based,  shape  infor-
mation-based,  local  features-based,  and  deep  learning-
based. 

The  first  approach  analyzes  the  images  based  on  skin 
color.  This  method  classifies  a  region  of  pixels  as  either 
skin or non-skin. The skin color can be detected manually 
using a color range [2], computed color histograms [5], or 

Figure 1: The mixture of CNNs in which the eight CNNs models are combined linearly. 

 

parametric  color  distribution  functions  [6].  Once  a  skin 
color model of the image has been defined, the adult image 
can be detected by a simple skin color histogram threshold, 
or by passing the statistics of the skin information to a clas-
sifier [4]. 

Often,  the  skin  areas  contain  some  shape  information 
such as ellipses or color compactness in certain regions of 
the human body. The structure of a group of skin color re-
gions  is  analyzed  to  see  how  they  are  connected.  Several 
methods  have  been  proposed  to  detect  the  shape  features 
such as contour-based features [2] where the outlines of the 
skin  region  are  extracted  and  used  as  feature,  Hu  and 
Zernike moments of the skin distribution [7], and Geometric 
constraints which model the human body geometry [8]. 

The third approach based on local features is inspired by 
the  success  of  local  features  in  other  image  recognition 
problems.  Scale  Invariant  Feature  Transform  (SIFT)  was 
used in conjunction  with bag  of  words to recognize adult 
images in [3]. The resulting features were trained using lin-
ear Support Vector Machine (SVM). Another local features 
called  Probabilistic  Latent  Semantic  Analysis  was  pro-
posed in [9] to convert the image into a certain number of 
topics for adult content recognition. 

The  fourth  and  the  most  recent  type  of  image  content 
recognition technique is the use of deep learning approach. 
Moustafa  [10]  adopted  AlexNet-based  classifier  [11]  and 
the GoogLeNet [12] model architecture. Both models were 
treated  as  consultants  in  an  ensemble  classifier.  Simple 
weighted average with equal weights was used to combine 
the predictions from the two models. Another model based 
on deep learning was proposed by Zhou, Kailong, et al. [13]. 
A  pre-trained  caffenet  model  was  developed  and  the  last 
two layers were fine-tuned with adult images dataset. 

3.  The Proposed Mixture of CNN Model   

The proposed network contains six convolutional layers 
followed by two fully-connected layers as shown in Figure 
2. The number of filters in each convolutional layer is mon-
otonically increasing from 16 to 128. A 2x2 Max-Pooling 
is  inserted  after  each  of  the  first  two  layers  and  after  the 
fourth and the sixth convolutional layer. The size of each 
filter is 3x3 with two pixel stride. To prevent the network 
from shrinking after each convolution, one pixel is added 
to  each  row  and  column  before  passing  the  image  or  the 
feature to the next convolution. After the six convolutional 
layers, the features bank is flattened and is passed to a fully-
connected layer with 128 neurons. The output layer which 

 

only contains one neuron is placed after the first fully-con-
nected  layer,  and  before  the  sigmoid  activation  function. 
Except for the last layer, a rectifier linear unit (Relu) is used 
as the activation function which is less prone to vanishing 
gradient  as  the  network  grows.  Another  reason  to  adapt 
Relu  is  that  it  operates  very  fast  as  only  a  simple  𝑚𝑎𝑥 
function is used. 

To  prevent  the  network  from  over-fitting  the  data,  two 
regularization techniques have been applied. The first tech-
nique applies  𝐿2  weight decay with 0.01 on the first fully-
connected layer. Dropout is also used to prevent over-fitting. 
Dropout works by randomly zeroing some of the neurons 
output at training to make the network more robust to small 
changes. Dropout is placed directly after each Max-Pooling, 
and also after the first fully-connected layer. The probabil-
ities of these four dropouts are set to 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 
0.4, respectively. 

The network is trained for 300 epochs, with each epoch 
consisting of multiple batches optimized with Adam [14]. 
The batch size is 128 and is trained with the cross-entropy 
loss function. As adult image recognition is a binary prob-
lem in which the output can be either positive or negative, 
the binary cross-entropy is used 

𝐿(𝑓, 𝑦) = − ∑ 𝑓 log 𝑦 + (1 − 𝑦) log(1 − 𝑓) 

(1) 

where  𝑓  is the predicted value and  𝑦  is the true value. 
 

Generally, the training time of deep CNN is very long. 
To  alleviate  this  problem,  we  introduce  a  way  to  extract 
eight sub-models with different weights in a single training 
session.

All the eight models are validated on the validation set 

and a  𝑁 × 8  matrix is constructed from the outputs 

𝐅 = [

where N  is  the  number  samples  in  the  validation  set,  and 
𝑓𝑖𝑁  is the predicted output of the i-th model of the N sam-
ples. The eight models combined linearly as, 

𝑧(𝑤) = {

1,
0,

𝑓1𝑤1 + 𝑓2𝑤2 + ⋯ + 𝑓8𝑤8 > 0

Finding  the  unknown  weights  vector  𝐖 = (𝑤1, … , 𝑤8) 
that minimizes  𝑚𝑖𝑛𝐖 (𝐘 − 𝐙(𝐖))2  is possible as long as 
N  >>  8.  This  problem  is  solved  using  Ordinary  Least 
Squares (OLS) as, 

𝐘 = [

𝑓11 … 𝑓81

⋱

] [

𝑤1

] 

 

𝐖 = (𝐅T𝐅)−1𝐅T𝐘

Usually, a model with a higher accuracy will get a 
higher weight than a model with lower accuracy. 

 

4.  Dataset 

Due to the nature of the problem, there is no recogniza-
ble  public  dataset  on  adult  content  recognition.  In  this 
research, we collected the data manually from the Internet 
yielding 41,154 adult images. For negative images, images 
from the ILSVRC-2013 [15] test set were used. These data 
are  separated  into  training,  validation,  and  testing  sets  as 
shown in Table 1.   

Each  image  is  resized,  centered,  and  cropped  from  the 
middle region to  128 × 128  pixels in RGB format. After 
that,  all  the  images  are  normalized  and  mean  subtracted. 
RGB images are fed as input to the network as they allow 
the first convolutional layer to extract the skin color infor-
mation  while the rest of the networks extract a  high level 
features based on body shape or textures. 

5.  Experimental results 

The CNN model is trained on 56,914 images and the val-
idation set is used to pick the best eight models. In order to 
increase  the  generality  of  the  model,  the  training  data  is 
augmented  by  flipping  each  image  horizontally.  This 
increases the total training images to 113,828.

We observe from Figure 3 that the accuracy increases in 
a steady manner during training while the validation accu-
racy  fluctuates  around  96%.  The  best  result  at  96.43%  is 
achieved at epoch 50. 

The CNN-Mixture  model  is  tested using the  validation 
and testing sets. Table 2 shows the performance of the eight 
models in CNN-Mixture on the validation and testing sets 
with increasing OLS weights with respect to the number of 
epoch. The performances of each model on the validation 
and testing are very close. We observe that the OLS weights 
of the models do not always reflect its performance on the 
validation  or  testing  sets.  For  example,  the  second  model 
has a higher OLS weight than the third and the fourth model. 
In addition, the first model has a negative value which re-
sults  in  opposite  contribution  to  the  output.  Hence,  we 
conjecture that the weight values represent the contribution 
of  the  model  to  the  overall  output  and  how  unique  the 
model is as compared to other models.   

Table  3  illustrates  the  performances  of  CNN-Mixture, 
Average-Sum, and also single CNN on the validation and 
testing  sets.  We  could  not  compare  our  result  with  other 
works as their data are not freely available and their codes 
are  not  publicly  accessible.  The  average  sum  model  is  a 
linear combination of eight models. All weights are set to 
0.125, so all models have the same contribution towards the 
output prediction. In contrast,  CNN-Mixture has different 
weights to reflect the performances of the individual model 
on the validation set.   

    We observe that the CNN-Mixture model gains small 
but  constant  accuracy  gain  in  both  validation  and  testing 
sets,  where  it  achieves  96.58%  on  validation  set  and 
96.59% testing set, respectively. From the experimental re-
sults, we find that CNN-Mixture can effectively distinguish

6.  Conclusion 

In this paper, we propose an adult image recognition  system 
using a mixture of CNN. The proposed model is end-to-end 
learnable as compared to traditional solutions such as skin 
color  detection.  The  proposed  method  is  formed  as  a  linear 
regression problem where the weights are calculated using or-
dinary  least  square.  The  proposed  model  is  tested  on  a 
manually  collected  large  dataset  consisting  of  over  hundred 
thousand  of  training  images.  Experiment  results  show  that 
CNN-Mixture  is  effective  against  recognition  of  adult 
images, yielding an accuracy of over 96% on the testing set.
