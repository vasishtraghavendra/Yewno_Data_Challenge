Abstract

In this study, a machine learning algorithm is used for disaggregation of SMAP brightness temperatures (TB)
from 36km to 9km. It uses image segmentation to cluster the study region based on meteorological and land cover
similarity, followed by a support vector machine based regression that computes the value of the disaggregated
TB at all pixels. High resolution remote sensing products such as land surface temperature, normalized difference
vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, precipitation, soil texture, and land-cover were used for disaggregation.
The algorithm was implemented in Iowa, United States, from April to July 2015, and compared with the SMAP
L3 SM AP TB product at 9km. It was found that the disaggregated TB were very similar to the SMAP-TB product,
even for vegetated areas with a mean difference ≤ 5K. However, the standard deviation of the disaggregation was
lower by 7K than that of the AP product. The probability density functions of the disaggregated TB were similar to
the SMAP-TB. The results indicate that this algorithm may be used for disaggregating TB using complex non-linear
correlations on a grid.

I. INTRODUCTION

Microwave observations are highly sensitive to near-surface soil moisture (SM) [1]–[10], and with the recent
launch of the NASA Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission along with the ESA SMOS mission, we
now have unprecedented global observations of SM every 2-3 days. The NASA-SMAP was expected to provide
SM at a spatial resolution of 9 km retrieved from combined active and passive (AP) observations at 1.26 and
1.41 GHz, respectively, every 2-3 days [11]. This spatial resolution is optimal for many hydrometeorological
applications [12]–[18]. However, on July 7th 2015, the radar on board SMAP halted its transmissions due to an
anomaly [19], creating a gap in the disaggregation of coarse scale radiometer observations (TB) available at 36km
to 9km using active observations to meet the mission requirements for the L3 SM AP product. A few studies have
attempted to disaggregate TB directly without the complementary information provided by active observations, such
as statistical inversion techniques [20]–[22]. These techniques allow discovery of non-linear correlations between
TB across scales. However, many of these methods require high-resolution TB for training, which is typically not
available. Piles et. al. [23] disaggregated TB directly into SM by applying the Universal Triangle (UT) method and
used a 2nd order regression-based linking model to relate coarse resolution SM to TB from the SMOS mission, and
other high resolution products, aggregated to the resolution of SMOS observations. The ﬁne scale SM was then
estimated using the assumption that the linking model at the coarse resolution also holds at ﬁner resolutions. The
robustness of this method over heterogeneous vegetation and weather conditions remain mostly untested. Treating
each pixel as a sample instead of using spatial information to regularize the disaggregation results in salt and
pepper noise due to spatial auto-correlation [24]. Moreover, these approaches use second order metrics, which do
not leverage all the information in the data that is necessary in a highly non-linear regression problem such as
disaggregation [25].

The goal of this study is to disaggregate SMAP TB observations from 36 km to 9 km without requiring in-situ
data for training. This is done using a version of the self regularized regressive model (SRRM) algorithm [26] that
includes kernel based support vector regression models in conjunction with coarse-scale spatial segmentation. The
segmentation algorithm separates the study region into discrete sets of pixels which have similar terrain conditions.
A support vector regression model is estimated for each set using coarse scale TB and auxiliary correlated data
which is further applied to the auxiliary data at ﬁne scale to obtain disaggregated TB. The primary objectives are to,
1) enhance the SRRM algorithm to disaggregate coarse SMAP TB to 9 km without ﬁne-scale TB as training, and
using other spatially correlated variables such as land surface temperature(LST), normalized difference vegetation
index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), precipitation (PPT), soil texture and land-cover (LC), 2) implement
the downscaling algorithm in Iowa in mid-western United States, and 3) compare the disaggregated TB to the SMAP
L3 SM AP TB at 9km product (hereafter referred to as SMAP-TB) during April 27 to July 5, 2015, when the
product is available.

II. THEORY

Disaggregation is an ill-posed problem constrained by the smoothness of the coarse-scale data which constrains
the generation of data at ﬁne scale because any added sharpness can be misconstrued as noise. Additional geospatial
and meteorological data that are correlated to TB are needed to ensure that the added sharpness has physical basis.
In this study, these auxiliary data-sets are utilized to create localized regression models that provide a mapping
from the TB at coarse scale to TB at ﬁne scale. To ensure that the localization is realistic and not arbitrary, the
coarse TB image is ﬁrst segmented into multiple regions of radiometric similarity. The overall organization and the
datasets involved is shown in Figure 1.

A. Self-Regularized Regressive Models (SRRM)

The ﬁrst step of the algorithm divides the study area into segments using the coarse scale TB. In this study,
the segmentation algorithm uses information theoretic measures of inter and intra segment similarity [27]. If X =
{x1, x2, x3 . . . xN} is a matrix containing TB for N pixels, the Cauchy-Schwarz cost-function, ˆJCS, estimates
optimal memberships of the pixels to segments, m, in an un-supervised manner.

To compute optimum values of m, and thus the membership of each pixel to the K segments, a Lagrange
multiplier formulation can be used along with a stochastic gradient descent scheme, the details of which are shown
in [26].

In the second step, support vector regression (SVR) [28], is used to generate the downscaled estimates. A training
set of pixels, for example ytrain is used in the regression to ﬁt a non-linear function, for example f, from the set
of the auxiliary data and coarse scale TB, for example z, to ﬁne scale TB. This function takes the form,

III. EXPERIMENTAL DESCRIPTION AND RESULTS

A. Study Area

The study was conducted in a 320 × 560 km2 region in the state of Iowa in the United States (US), stretching
from 40.36◦ to 43.57◦N and 90.14◦ to 96.68◦W, equivalent to 162 SMAP pixels. Iowa, with an area of about
1.7 × 105 km2, out of which 1.2 × 105 km2 is cropland, is one of the most important agricultural areas in the
US responsible for > 70% of the country’s agricultural gross domestic product [31], and includes a SMAP core
validation site in the South Fork watershed. The percentage of silt, clay and soil is also shown in the study region
in Figure 2.

To downscale TB at 36 km to 9 km, satellite based observations of EVI, NDVI, LST, PPT were used from April
20 to June 30 2015. LC and soil texture (STEX) were also used and considered to be constant for the duration of
the study. The products used in this study along with their native and interpolated spatio-temporal resolutions are
listed in Table I. LST, EVI and NDVI, available at ∼ 1 km, were interpolated to 9km through spatial averaging.
For this study, LC is available as a categorical data product at a spatial resolution of 30 m. LC was recategorized
into seven groups and the ratio of each group within a 1 km pixel was used. The two groups occupying the largest
area had corn and soybean land covers. Agricultural areas with other crops were conglomerated and referred to as
’miscellaneous’ and used as a single group. Some forests, wetlands, and developed regions were also present in the
study area and used as three groups. Anything that could not be categorized into the 6 groups, mentioned above,
were assigned to a group referred to as ’others’. The ratio of each group within a single 1-km pixel is shown in
Figures 3(a) through (f). The 9 km LC was obtained by linearly averaging the ratios obtained at 1 km.

B. Implementation in Iowa

In the modiﬁed SRRM algorithm, the DCS based clustering algorithm to discover regions of similarity in the
study area. In Equation 1 from Section II.A., X = {[TB,1, lat1, lon1] , [TB,1, lat2, lon2] , . . . , [TB,M, latM , lonM ]}
where M is the total number of coarse pixels in the region and lati and loni are the latitude and longitude of the
ith pixel. The number of clusters, N, is used as a parameter. Since no ground truth is available in the region, N
is determined using the principle of minimum description length as described in [32] is used. After clustering, M
models, ˆf1, ˆf2, . . . , ˆfM are developed using NDVI, EVI, PPT, LST, LC and STEX aggregated to 36km along with
the coarse scale TB using Equation 4. The disaggregated value of TB at 9km is then computed by applying the
learnt functions ˆf1, ˆf2, . . . , ˆfM to NDVI, EVI, PPT, LST and LC values aggregated to 9km.

The means and standard deviations of the disaggregated TB and SMAP-TB are compared to provide an index
of the intra-season variability captured in the TB, as shown in Figure 4. The means are preserved by the multiscale
SRRM algorithm with differences of ≤ 0.5K, while the average standard-deviation of the disaggregated TB is 7K
lower than that for the SMAP-TB. The maximum difference between the standard deviations of the disaggregated
TB and SMAP-TB is observed when TB shows a decreases sharply on DoY 139 and DoY 161 due to high spatial
variability in PPT, and the TB is underestimated for areas with high PPT which decreases the standard deviation in
disaggregated TB because of a 4-hour time lag between the SMAP and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM)
observations. Any rainfall that occurs in this time is not indicated by the GPM PPT product but affects the TB.

In addition, the disaggregated TB images on three days during May and June are compared with SMAP-TB, to
determine spatial diversity under increasing amounts of vegetation and different precipitation conditions. On DoY
125 (May 5), the precipitation is heterogeneous across the region, as shown in Figure 5(b). The disaggregated
TB captures the decrease in TB in the east-central region of Iowa due to high PPT adequately, similar to the
SMAP-TB at 9km. The major variability in the inputs and SMAP-TB are present in the disaggregated TB. It is
also smoother compared to SMAP-TB which suggests low noise levels because any two neighbouring pixels differ
by ≤ 10K in the disaggregated TB. Similar performance is observed for DoYs 157 (June 6) and 181 (June 30),
shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7 respectively. The locations of the clusters also change on both the days according
to the spatial patterns of TB. Furthermore, even when the NDVI and EVI are high, as observed for DoY 181, the
disaggregated TB is similar as compared to the SMAP-TB. On DoY 181, the LST is unavailable for a lot of the
pixels in the study region, which reduces the heterogeneity in disaggregated TB because the spatial patterns in LST
cannot be utilized for disaggregation. However, as shown in Figure 7(b), the spatial distribution of the disaggregated
TB is comparable to the SMAP-TB. Thus,the multiscale SRRM algorithm is sufﬁciently robust to vegetation levels
and LCs.

The probability density functions (PDF) of the disaggregated TB, coarse scale SMAP TB at 36km, and SMAP-
TB at 9km are estimated to facilitate inter-comparisons and further elucidate the relationship among the three
products. The statistical similarity of disaggregated TB to the coarse scale SMAP TB is shown in Figure 8. The
PDF of disaggregated TB is closer to the PDF of coarse scale SMAP TB than the SMAP-TB which shows that the
disaggregated TB is more closely coupled to the coarse scale SMAP TB. This demonstrates that the multi-scale
SRRM algorithm can be operationally used to disaggregate the coarse scale SMAP TB to 9 km.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this study, a disaggregation methodology from 36km to 9km was developed and implemented that preserves
the high variability in TB due to heterogeneous meteorological and vegetation conditions. The multiscale SRRM
preserves heterogeneity by utilizing a segmentation algorithm to create a number of regions of similarity which
subsequently, are used in a support vector machine regression framework. The clusters were computed using RS
products, viz. PPT, EVI, NDVI, LC and Soil Texture. It was found that the difference between the means of the
disaggregated TB and SMAP-TB is ≤ 5K for all days while the average variance is ≤ 7K. The disaggregated TB
and SMAP-TB were alike even under highly vegetated conditions. The PDFs of the disaggregated TB were found
to be closer to the PDF of the coarse scale SMAP TB than the PDF of the SMAP-TB product. The results indicate
that this algorithm can be used for disaggregating TB with complex non-linear correlations on a grid with high
accuracy.
