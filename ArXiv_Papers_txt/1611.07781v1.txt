Adaptive Down-Sampling and Dimension
Reduction in Elastic Kernel Machines for
Efﬁcient Recognition of Isolated Gestures

Pierre-Francois Marteau and Sylvie Gibet and Clément Reverdy

Abstract

In the scope of gestural action recognition, the size of the feature vector repre-
senting movements is in general quite large especially when full body movements
are considered. Furthermore, this feature vector evolves during the movement per-
formance so that a complete movement is fully represented by a matrix M of size
DxT , whose element Mi, j represents the value of feature i at timestamps j. Many
studies have addressed dimensionality reduction considering only the size of the
feature vector lying in RD to reduce both the variability of gestural sequences ex-
pressed in the reduced space, and the computational complexity of their processing.
In return, very few of these methods have explicitly addressed the dimensionality
reduction along the time axis. Yet this is a major issue when considering the use of
elastic distances which are characterized by a quadratic complexity along the time
axis. We present in this paper an evaluation of straightforward approaches aiming at
reducing the dimensionality of the matrix M for each movement, leading to consider
both the dimensionality reduction of the feature vector as well as its reduction along
the time axis. The dimensionality reduction of the feature vector is achieved by se-
lecting remarkable joints in the skeleton performing the movement, basically the
extremities of the articulatory chains composing the skeleton. The temporal dimen-
sionality reduction is achieved using either a regular or adaptive down-sampling that
seeks to minimize the reconstruction error of the movements. Elastic and Euclidean
kernels are then compared through support vector machine learning. Two data sets

that are widely referenced in the domain of human gesture recognition, and quite
distinctive in terms of quality of motion capture, are used for the experimental as-
sessment of the proposed approaches. On these data sets we experimentally show
that it is feasible, and possibly desirable, to signiﬁcantly reduce simultaneously the
size of the feature vector and the number of skeleton frames to represent body move-
ments while maintaining a very good recognition rate. The method proves to give
satisfactory results at a level currently reached by state-of-the-art methods on these
data sets. We experimentally show that the computational complexity reduction that
is obtained makes this approach eligible for real-time applications.

1 Introduction

Gesture recognition is a challenging task in the computer vision community with
numerous applications using motion data such as interactive entertainment, human-
machine interaction, automotive, or digital home. Recently, there is an increasing
availability of large and heterogeneous motion captured data characterized by a var-
ious range of qualities, depending on the type and quality of the motion sensors.
We thus separate (i) databases of high resolution and quality built from expensive
capturing devices and requiring a particular expertise, (ii) and low resolution and
noisier databases produced with cheap sensors that do not require any speciﬁc ex-
pertise. Such databases open new challenges for assessing the robustness and gen-
eralization capabilities of gesture recognition algorithms on diversiﬁed motion data
sets. Besides the quality of recognition, the complexity of the algorithms and their
computational cost is indeed a major issue, especially in the context of real-time
interaction.

We address in this paper the recognition of isolated gestures from motion cap-
tured data. As motion data are generally represented by high-dimensional time
series, many approaches have been developed to reduce their dimension, so that
the recognition process is more efﬁcient while being still accurate. Among them,
low-dimensional embeddings of motion data have been proposed that enable to
characterize and parameterize action sequences. Some of them are based on sta-
tistical descriptors [Hussein et al., 2013], rely on relevant meaningful trajectories
[Oﬂi et al., 2013], or characterize the style[Hussein et al., 2013]. In this paper we
focus on dimensionality reduction along two complementary axes: the spatial axis
representing the conﬁguration of the skeleton at each frame, and the temporal axis
representing the evolution over time of the skeletal joints trajectories. With such an
approach, two main challenges are combined simultaneously:

• We use relevant trajectories (end-extremities) whose content may characterize

complex actions;

• Considering that the temporal variability is of primary importance when rec-
ognizing skilled actions and expressive motion, we apply an adaptive temporal
down-sampling to reduce the complexity of elastic matching.

These low-dimensional dual-based representations will be coupled with appropriate
recognition algorithms that we expect to be more tractable and efﬁcient.

Our recognition principle is based on a recent method that improves the perfor-
mance of classical support vector machines when used with regularized elastic ker-
nels dedicated to time series matching. Our objective is to show how the spatial and
temporal dimensionality reductions, associated with such regularized elastic ker-
nels signiﬁcantly improve the efﬁciency, in terms of response time, of the algorithm
while preserving the recognition rates.

The second section brieﬂy presents the related works and state-of-the-art for iso-
lated gesture recognition. In the third section we describe the nature of the motion
data as well as the main pre-processing of the data. The fourth section gives the ma-
jor keypoints of the method, positioning it in the context of multivariate sequential
data classiﬁcation. We present in the ﬁfth part the evaluation of our algorithm car-
ried out on two data sets with very distinct qualities and compare its performance
with those obtained by some of the state-of-the-art methods. A ﬁnal discussion is
provided as well as some perspectives.

2 Related work

In human gesture recognition, there are two main challenges to be addressed: dimen-
sion reduction closely linked to feature descriptors, and recognition models which
cover different aspects of dynamic modeling, statistical and machine learning ap-
proaches. In this section, we give a brief and non-exhaustive overview of the litera-
ture associated with each challenge.

Dimension reduction
The problem of dimensionality reduction (also called manifold learning) can be
addressed with the objective to ﬁnd a low-dimensional space that best represents the
variance of the data without loosing too much information.Action descriptors have
thus been deﬁned for characterizing whole motion sequences, or punctual frames
that need additional step of temporal modeling to achieve the recognition goal.

Numerous method are available to carry out such dimensionality reduction,
the most popular being linear approaches such as Principal Component Analysis
(PCA, [Jolliffe, 1986],
[Masoud and Papanikolopoulos, 2003]), Linear Discrimi-
nant Analysis (LDA, [McLachlan, 2004]), or linear projections preserving locally
neighborhoods (Locality Preserving Projection) [He and Niyogi, 2003]. Among non-
linear approaches, Locally Linear Embeddings (LLE, [Roweis and Saul, 2000]),
Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS, [Kruskal and Wish, 1978]) and variants
like Laplacian Eigenmap [Belkin and Niyogi, 2002], Isomap [Tenenbaum et al., 2000]
have been implemented to embed postures in low dimensional spaces in which a
more efﬁcient time warp (DTW, see section 5) algorithm can be used to classify
movements. An extension of this method, called ST-Isomap, considers temporal
relationships in local neighborhoods that can be propagated globally via a shortest-

path mechanism [Jenkins and Matari´c, 2004]. Models based on Gaussian processes
with latent variables are also largely used, for instance a hierarchical version has
been recently exploited for gesture recognition [Han et al., 2010].

Other methods deﬁne discriminative features that best classify motion classes.
This is the case in the work of [Yu and Aggarwal, 2009] that reduces the mo-
tion data to only ﬁve end-extremities of the skeleton (two feet, two hands and
the head), thus giving some meaningful insight of the motion related to the action
task. [Fothergill et al., 2012] and [Zhao et al., 2012] have in particular applied ran-
dom forests to recognize actions, using a Kinect sensor, while [Oﬂi et al., 2013]
recently proposed to automatically select the most informative skeletal joints to
explain the current action. In the same line, [Hussein et al., 2013] use the covari-
ance matrix for skeleton joint locations over time as a discriminative descriptor
to characterize a movement sequence. Multiple covariance matrices are deployed
over sub-sequences in a hierarchical fashion in order to encode the relationship be-
tween joint movement and time. In [Li et al., 2010] a simple bag of 3D points is
used to represent and recognize gestural action. Similarly, in [Wang et al., 2012],
actionlets are deﬁned from Fourrier coefﬁcients to characterize the most discrimi-
native joints. Finally, it can be mentioned, among many existing applications that
address the use of elastic distances into a recognition process, the recent work de-
scribed in [Sempena et al., 2011], as well as the hardware acceleration proposed in
[Hussain and Rashid, 2012]. However, to our knowledge, no work exploiting this
type of distance has directly studied the question of data reduction along the time
axis.

Gesture recognition Recognition methods essentially aim at modeling the dy-

namics of gestures. Some approaches, based on linear dynamic models [Veeraraghavan et al., 2004],
have used autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) models
to characterize the kinematics of movements, while other approaches, based on non-
linear dynamic models [Bissacco et al., 2007], have developed movement analysis
and recognition scheme based on dynamical models controlled by Gaussian pro-
cesses. [Mitra and Acharya, 2007] propose a synthesis of the major gesture recogni-
tion approaches relying on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Histograms of oriented
4D normals have also been proposed in [Oreifej and Liu, 2013] for the recognition
of gestural actions from sequences of depth images. [Wang et al., 2006] have ex-
ploited conditional random ﬁelds to model joint dependencies and thus increase the
discrimination of HMM-like models. Recurrent neural network models have also
been used [Martens and Sutskever, 2011]; among them, conditional restricted Boltz-
man’s machines [Larochelle et al., 2012] have been studied recently in the context
of motion captured data modeling and classiﬁcation.

In this paper, we propose a new representation of human actions that results from
a dual-based reduction method that occurs both spatially and temporally. We cou-
ple this representation to a SVM classiﬁcation method associated with regularized
elastic kernels.

3 Motion representation

We are working on isolated human motions acquired through motion captured
databases. In recent years, there is an increasing availability of these databases, some
of them being captured by high resolution devices (infrared marker-tracking sys-
tem), such as those provided by CMU [cmu mocap db, 2003], HDM05 [Müller et al., 2007],
and other ones captured by low-cost devices, such as MSRAction3D captured with
the Microsoft Kinect system. With the ﬁrst type of sensors, the acquisition process is
expensive, as it necessitates for capturing skilled motion with a good accuracy sev-
eral cameras with many markers located on an actor, and a post-processing pipeline
which is costly in time and expertise. Instead, with the second type of sensors, the
data acquisition is affordable and necessitates less time and expertise, but with a loss
of accuracy which remains acceptable for some tasks.

After the recording, the captured data is ﬁltered and reconstructed so that to
eliminate most of the noise, data loss and labelling errors (markers inversion),
and the output of this acquisition pipeline is generally a set of 3D-trajectories of
the skeleton joints determined from the positions of markers. This kind of data
is inherently noisy, mainly due to the quality of the sensors and the acquisition
process, but also to approximations made during the reconstruction process. The
modeling of the skeleton is indeed subject to some variation for different reasons:
in particular the markers being positioned on cloths or on the skin of the actor’s
body, they can move during the capturing process, also the determination of the
segment lengths, of the joints’ centers and their associated rotation axis are not
trivial and lead to modeling errors. To overcome these difﬁculties, the skeleton
model is obtained through an optimization process such as the ones described in
[de Aguiar et al., 2006], [O’Brien et al., 2000], or [Shotton et al., 2011]. The tech-
niques based on a skeleton model hence convert 3D sensor data into Cartesian or
angular coordinates that deﬁne the state of the joints over time with various accura-
cies.

Figure 1 presents two skeletons reconstructed from two very distinct capture sys-
tems. On the right, the skeleton is reconstructed from data acquired via the Microsoft
Kinect, on the left from the Vicon-MX device used by the Max Planck Institute to
produce the HDM05 datasets.

Thus, any skeletal-based model can be represented by a hierarchical tree-like
structure composed of rigid segments (bones) connected by joints. A motion can
be deﬁned by a sequence of postures over time, formalized as a multivariate state
vector describing a trajectory over time, i.e. a time series: {Yt ∈ Rk}T
1 = [Y1, ...,YT ],
where the k spatial dimension (k = 3·N, with N the number of joints) typically varies
between 20 and 100 according to the capture devices and the considered task. As this
state vector is obviously not composed of independent scalar dimensions, the spatio-
temporal encoded redundancies open solutions for dimension reduction as well as
noise reduction approaches. This is particularly relevant for motion recognition, as
the objective is to aim at improving computation time and error rate.

from the Vicon-MX device used by the Max Planck Institute (right).

4 Dimension reduction of motion capture data

Using elastic distances or kernels for recognition problems has proved to be very ac-
curate and efﬁcient. However, one of the main difﬁculty of such methods with time
series data is to deal with their computational cost, in general quadratic with the
length of the time series and linear with the spatial dimension characterized by the
number of degrees-of-freedom. This high computational complexity is potentially
limiting their use, especially when large amounts of data have to be processed, or
when real-time constraint is required. We therefore expect that a dual dimension-
ality reduction, both on the time and spatial axis is particularly relevant, especially
when associated to these techniques. Hence, for motion recognition using elastic
distances, we propose to show that there exists a spatio-temporal redundancy in
motion data that can be exploited.

Considering the quite rich literature on motion recognition, it appears that while
some studies have shown success with dimensionality reduction on the spatial axis,
very few have directly addressed a dimensionality reduction along the time axis , and
much less work by combining the two approaches. [Keogh and Pazzani, 2000] has
however proposed a temporal sub-sampling associated with dynamic time warping
in the context of time series mining, followed later by [Marteau, 2009]. We address
herein after these two lines of research.

4.1 Dimension reduction along the spatial axis

Dimension reduction (or manifold learning), is the process consisting of mapping
high dimensional data to representations lying in a lower-dimensional manifold.
This can be interpreted as mapping the data into a space characterized by a smaller
dimension, from which most of the variability of the data can be reproduced.

We consider in this paper a more direct approach based on the knowledge of the
mechanism underlying the production of motion data and the way human beings
perceive and discriminate body movements. We make the assumption that the per-
ception of human motion is better achieved in the so-called task-space represented
by a selection of signiﬁcant 3D joint trajectories. This hypothesis is supported by
[Giese et al., 2008] who show that visual perception of body motion closely reﬂects
physical similarities between joint trajectories. This is also consistent with the mo-
tor theory of motion perception presented in [Gibet et al., 2011]. Besides, we may
reasonably accept that these joint trajectories embed sufﬁcient discriminative infor-
mation as inverse kinematics (widely used in computer animation and robotics) has
shown to be very efﬁcient and robust to reconstruct the whole skeleton movement
from the knowledge of the end effector trajectories (hands, feet, head), possibly with
the additional knowledge of mid-articulated joints trajectories (such as elbows and
knees) and constraints. Hence a straightforward approach consists in constructing a
motion descriptor that discards all joints information but the 3D positions of the mid
and end effectors extremities. We thus select the 3D positions for the two wrists, the
two ankles (the ﬁngers and toes markers are less reliable in general), the two el-
bows, the two knees and the head. This leads to a time-varying descriptor lying in a
18D space, while a full body descriptor is embedded in a 60D, space for the Kinect
sensor, signiﬁcantly more for vicon settings in general.

4.2 Dimension reduction along the time axis

The straightforward approach we are developing to explicitly reduce dimensional-
ity along the time axis consists in sub-sampling the movement data such that each
motion trajectories takes the form of a ﬁxed-size sequence of L skeletal postures.
Then it becomes easy to perform a classiﬁcation or recognition task by using elastic
kernel machines on such ﬁxed-size sequences. With such an approach, performance
rates depend on the chosen degree of sub-sampling. This approach seems coarse
since long sequences are characterized with the same number of skeletal poses than
short sequences. For very short sequences, whose lengths are shorter than L, if any,
we over-sample the sequence to meet the ﬁxed-size requirement. But we consider
this case as very marginal since we seek a sub-sampling rate much lower than the
average sequence of movement length. In the following, we will experiment and
compare uniform and adaptive down-sampling.

4.2.1 Uniform down-sampling

In order to explicitly reduce dimensionality along the time axis, our ﬁrst straightfor-
ward approach here consists in down-sampling the motion data so that each motion
trajectory takes the form of a ﬁxed-size sequence of L skeletal postures, evenly dis-
tributed along the time axis. We refer to this approach as uniform down-sampling
(UDS).

4.2.2 Adaptive down-sampling

The second approach is the so-called adaptive down-sampling (ADS) approach.
Similarly to UDS, each motion trajectory takes the form of a ﬁxed-size sequence
of L skeletal postures, but these postures are not evenly distributed anymore along
the time axis. They are selected such as to minimize a trajectory reconstruction cri-
teria. Basically we follow the previous work by [Marteau and Gibet, 2006]. A data
modeling approach is used to handle the adaptive sampling of the {Yt } multidimen-
sional and discrete time series. More precisely, we are seeking an approximation Yq ∗
of Y such as:

(E({Yt}, {Yq ,t}))

(1)

q ∗ = ArgMin

q

localization of the 25 selected samples (red circles): motion capture data (blue) and reconstructed
data by linear interpolation (red).

where E is the RMS error between Y and Yq selected among the set of piecewise
linear approximations deﬁned from Y . Since the optimal solution of the optimization
problem deﬁned by Eq. 1 is O(L.n2), where n is the length of the input time series,

we adopt a near to optimal solution as developed in [Marteau and Ménier, 2009]
whose complexity is O(n). As an example, in ﬁgure 2 the human wrist 3D trajectory
is down-sampled using 25 samples positioned along the trajectory by minimizing
the piecewise linear approximation.

5 Elastic kernels and their regularization

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), [Velichko and Zagoruyko, 1970], [Sakoe and Chiba, 1971],
by far the most used elastic measure, is deﬁned as

ddtw(Xp,Yq) = d2

E (x(p),y(q))

(2)

ddtw(Xp−1,Yq)
sup
ddtw(Xp−1,Yq−1) sub
ins
ddtw(Xp,Yq−1)

+ Min


where dE (x(p),y(q) is the Euclidean distance (possibly the square of the Euclidean
distance) deﬁned on Rk between the two postures in sequences X and Y taken at
times p and q respectively.

When performed by a support vector machine (SVM) model, the optimization
problem inherent to this type of learning algorithm is no longer quadratic. Moreover,
the convergence towards the optimorum is no longer guaranteed, which, depending
on the complexity of the task may be considered as detrimental.

Besides the fact that the DTW measure does not respect the triangle inequality,
it is furthermore not possible to directly deﬁne a positive deﬁnite kernel from it.
Hence, the optimization problem, inherent to the learning of a kernel machine, is no
longer quadratic which could, at least on some tasks, be a source of limitation.

Regularized DTW: recent works [Cuturi et al., 2007], [Marteau and Gibet, 2014]
allowed to propose new guidelines to regularize kernels constructed from elastic
measures such as DTW. A simple instance of such regularized kernel, derived from
[Marteau and Gibet, 2014] for time series of equal length, takes the following form,
which relies on two recursive terms :

where D p,q is the Kronecker’s symbol, n ∈ R+ is a stiffness parameter which weights
the local contributions, i.e. the distances between locally aligned positions, and
dE (., .) is a distance deﬁned on Rk.
The initialization is simply Kxy

rdtw(X0,Y0) = Kxx

rdtw(X0,Y0) = 1.

The main idea behind this line of regularization is to replace the operators min
and max (which prevent the symmetrization of the kernel) by a summation operator
((cid:229)
). This leads to consider, not only the best possible alignment, but also all the
best (or nearly the best) paths by summing up their overall cost. The parameter n
is
used to control what we call nearly-the-best alignment, thus penalizing more or less
alignments too far from the optimal ones. This parameter can be easily optimized
through a cross-validation.

5.1 Normalization

As Krdtw evaluates the sum on all possible alignment paths of the products of local
E (x(p),y(p))/(2.s 2) ≤ 1, its values can be very small depending on
alignment costs e−d2
the size of the time series and the selected value for s . Hence, KDTW values tend
to 0 when s
tends towards 0, except when the two compared time series are iden-
tical (the corresponding Gram matrix suffers from a diagonal dominance problem).
As proposed in [Marteau and Gibet, 2014], a manner to avoid numerical troubles
consists in using the following normalized kernel:

˜Krdtw(., .) = exp(cid:18)a

log(Krdtw(., .)) − log(min(Krdtw))

log(max(Krdtw)) − min(Krdtw)) (cid:19)

where max(Krdtw) and min(Krdtw) respectively are the max and min values taken by
the kernel on the learning data set and a > 0 a positive constant (a = 1 by default). If
we forget the proportionality constant, this leads to take the kernel Krdtw at a power
t = a /(log(max(Krdtw)) − log(min(Krdtw))), which shows that the normalized ker-

nel ˜Krdtw (cid:181) Kt

rdtw is still positive deﬁnite ([Berg et al., 1984], Proposition 2.7).

We consider in this paper the non deﬁnite exponential kernel (Gaussian or Radial
Basis Function (RBF) types) Kdtw = e−ddtw(.,.)/(2.s 2) constructed directly from the
elastic measures ddtw, the normalized regularized elastic kernel Kt
rdtw, and the non-
elastic kernel obtained from the Euclidean distance 1, i.e., KE (., .) = e−d2

E (.,.)/s .

6 Experimentation

To estimate the robustness of the proposed approaches, we evaluate them on two
motion capture databases of opposite quality, the ﬁrst one, called HDM05, devel-
oped at the Max Planck Institute, the other one, called MSR-Action3D, at Microsoft
research laboratories.

HDM05 data set [Müller et al., 2007] consists of data captured at 120Hz by a
Vicon MX system composed of a set of reﬂective optical markers followed by six
high-deﬁnition cameras and conﬁgured to record data at 120hz. The movement se-
quences are segmented and transformed into sequences of skeletal poses consisting
of N = 31 joints, each associated to a 3D position (x,y,z). In practice the posi-
tion of the root of the skeleton (located near its center of mass) and its orientation
serving as referential coordinates, only the relative positions of the remaining 30
joints are used, which leads to represent each position by a vector YT ∈ Rk , with
k = 90. We consider two recognition/classiﬁcation tasks: HDM05-1 and HDM05-
2 that are respectively those proposed in [Oﬂi et al., 2012] (also exploited in the
work of [Hussein et al., 2013]) and [Oﬂi et al., 2013]. For both tasks, three subjects
are involved during learning and two separate subjects are involved during testing.
For task HDM05-1, 11 gestural actions are processed: {deposit ﬂoor, elbow to knee,
grab high, hop both legs, jog, kick forward, lie down ﬂoor, rotate both arms back-
ward, sneak, squat, and throw basketball}. This constitutes 249 motion sequences.
For task HDM05-2 , the subjects are the same, but ﬁve additional gestural actions
are considered in addition to the previous 11: {jump, jumping jacks, throw, sit down,
and stand up}. For this task, the data set includes 393 movement sequences in total.
For both tests, the lengths of the gestural sequences are between 56 and 901 postures
(corresponding to a movement duration between 0.5-7.5 sec.) .

MSR-Action3D data set: This database [Li et al., 2010] has recently been devel-
oped to provide a Kinect data benchmark. It consists of 3D depth image sequences
(depth map) captured by the Microsoft Kinect sensor. It contains 20 typical interac-
tion gestures with a game console that are labeled as follows high arm wave, hor-
izontal arm wave, hammer, hand catch, forward punch, high throw, draw x, draw

1 The Euclidean distance is usable only because a ﬁxed number of skeletal positions is considered
to characterize each movement, and this, irrespectively of their initial length

tick, draw circle, hand clap, two hand wave, side-boxing, bend, forward kick, side
kick, jogging, tennis swing, tennis serve, golf swing, pickup & throw . Each action
was carried out by 10 subjects facing the camera, 2 or 3 times. This data set includes
567 motion sequences whose lengths vary from 14 to 76 skeletal poses. The 3D im-
ages of size 640 × 480 were captured at a frequency of 15hz. From each 3D image a
skeletal posture has been extracted with N = 20 joints, each one being characterized
by three coordinates. As for the previous data set, we characterize postures rela-
tively to the referential coordinates located at the root of the skeleton, which leads
to represent each posture by a vector Yt ∈ Rk, with k = 3 × 19 = 57. The task is to
provide a cross-validation on the subjects, i.e. 5 subjects participating in learning
and 5 subjects participating in testing, considering all possible conﬁgurations which
represent 252 learning/testing pairs in total.

Hence, we perform three classiﬁcation tasks: HDM05-1, HDM05-2 and MSRAc-
tion3D, with or without a spatial dimensionality reduction while simultaneously
considering a down-sampling on the time axis:

• The spatial dimensionality reduction is obtained by constructing a frame (skele-
tal pose) descriptor composed only with the end-effector trajectories in 3D
(EED) comparatively to a full-body descriptor (FBD) that integrates all the
joints trajectories that compose the skeleton. The FBD rests in a 90D space
for HDM05 and in a 60D space for MSRAction3D. The EED rests in a 24D
space (3D positions for 2 elbows, 2 hands, two knees and two feet) for the three
tasks, leading to a data compression of 73% for HDM05 and 55% for MSRAc-
tion3D.

• The dimensionality reduction on the time axis is obtained through either a uni-
form down-sampling (UDS) or an adaptive down-sampling (ADS) based on a
piecewise approximation of the FBD or EED trajectories. The number of skele-
tal poses varies from 5 to 30 for each trajectories, leading to an average data
compression of 97% for HDM05 and 74% for MSRAction3D.

Fig. 5 Classiﬁcation accuracies for the MSRAction3D data set, uniform down-sampling, full body
(top), adaptive down-sampling, full body (middle), adaptive down-sampling, end effector extremi-
ties (bottom), when the number of skeletal poses varies: KE (red, circle, dash), Kdtw (black, square,
plain), Kt
rdtw (blue, star, dotted). Additionally, the cross validation on subjects (252 tests) allows to
show the variance of the results.

6.1 Results and analysis

For the three considered tasks, we present the results obtained using a SVM classi-
ﬁer built from the LIBSVM library [Chang and Lin, 2011], the elastic non deﬁnite
kernel Kdtw = e−ddtw(.,.)/(2.s 2), the elastic deﬁnite kernel Kt
rdtw, and as a baseline, the
Euclidean RBF kernel, KE = e−d2

E (.,.)/(2.s 2).

Figures 3, 4 and 5 present the classiﬁcation accuracies for respectively the
HDM05-1, HDM05-2 and MSRAction3D tasks for the test data when the number of
skeletal postures selected after down-sampling varies between 5 and 30. For these
three ﬁgures, the top sub-ﬁgure presents classiﬁcation accuracies when the FBD
(Full Body) descriptor associated to a uniform down sampling (UDS) are used, the
middle sub-ﬁgure classiﬁcation accuracies when the FBD (Full Body) descriptor
associated to an adaptive down sampling (ADS) are used, and the bottom sub-ﬁgure
gives classiﬁcation accuracies when the EED (End Extremities) descriptor associ-
ated to an adaptive down sampling (ADS) is used.

On all three ﬁgures, we observe that the down-sampling does not degrade the
classiﬁcation accuracies when the number of poses is over 10, and for some tasks it
may even signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy. This is likely due to the noise ﬁltering
effect of the down-sampling. High levels of down-sampling (e.g. when 10 to 15 pos-
tures are retained to describe movements, which represents an average compression
ratio of 97 % for HDM05 and 70 % on MSRAction3D) lead to very satisfactory
results (90 to 98 % for the two HDM05 tasks: Figures 3 and 4, and 82 to 86 %
for the MSRAction3D task: 5). Best results are obtained for a number of skeletal
poses between 15 and 20, when the EED descriptor is used in conjunction with an
adaptive down sampling. The SVM classiﬁer constructed on the basis of the regular-
ized kernel Kt
rdtw produces the best recognition rates (>= 96 % for the two HDM05
tasks). We note that the MSRAction3D task is much more difﬁcult since it consists
in a cross validation based on the performing subjects. Much lower performance are
obtained for the SVM built on the basis of the Euclidean distance; in addition, if
very good classiﬁcation rate (96 %) is obtained on the training data, due to the noisy
nature of Kinect data and the inter subject variability, the recognition rate on the test
data falls down from 82 to 86 % .

Table 1 gives for the MSRAction3D data set and for the SVM based on KE ,Kdtw
and Kt
rdtw kernels, means and standard deviations, obtained on the training data (L)
and testing data (T), of recognition rates (classiﬁcation accuracies) when perform-
ing the cross-validation over the 10 subjects (5 train - 5 test splits leading to 252
tests), for the full body descriptor (FBD) and the end extremities descriptor (EED)
associated either to a uniform down-sampling (UDS) or an adaptive Down Sam-
pling (ADS). For this test, movements are represented as sequences of 15 skeletal
postures. The drop of accuracies between learning and testing phases is due, on this
dataset, to the large inter subjects variability of movement performances. Neverthe-
less, our experiment shows that the best average classiﬁcation accuracies (obtained
in general with minimal variance) are obtained for the most compact movement rep-

sampling. This is true both for the training and testing datasets.

For comparison, table 2 gives results obtained by different methods of the state-
of-the-art and compare them with the performance of an SVM that exploits the
regularized DTW kernel (Kt
rdtw) associated to the end extremity descriptor (EED)
and an adaptive down-sampling (ADS) of 15 skeletal poses. To that end, we have
reimplemented the Cov3DJ approach [Hussein et al., 2013] to get, for the MSRAc-
tion3D data set, the average result given by a 5-5 cross-validation on the subjects
(252 tests). This comparative analysis shows that the SVM constructed from regu-
larized DTW kernel provides results slightly above the current state-of-the-art for
the considered data sets and tasks.

# Skeletal poses

Fig. 6 Elapsed time as a function of the number of skeletal poses (10 to 30 poses): i) RBF Eu-
clidean Kernel, Red/round/dashed line, ii) RBF DTW kernel, Black/square/plain line, iii) normal-
ized regularized DTW kernel(Kt

rdtw), blue/star/dotted line.

Finally, in Figure 6, we give the average CPU elapsed time for the processing of a
single gestural MSRAction3D action when varying the number of retained skeletal
poses. The test has been performed on an Intel Core i7-4800MQ CPU, 2.70GHz.
Although the computational cost for the elastic kernel is quadratic, the latency for
the classiﬁcation of a single gestural action using a SVM-Kt
rdtw is less than 25 mil-
liseconds when 15 poses are considered, which effectively meets easily real-time
requirements.

7 Conclusion and perspectives

In the context of isolated action recognition, where few studies explicitly consider
dimension reduction along both the spatial and time axes simultaneously, we have
presented a recognition model based on the dimensionality reduction of the skeletal
pose descriptor and the down-sampling of motion sequences coupled to elastic ker-
nel machines. Two ways of down-sampling have been considered: a uniform down-
sampling that evenly selects samples along the time axis and an adaptive down-
sampling based on a piecewise linear approximation model. The dimensionality re-
duction of the skeletal pose descriptor is straightforwardly obtained by considering
only end effector trajectories, which is consistent with some sensorimotor percep-
tual evidence about the way human beings perceive and interpret motion. On the
data sets and tasks that we have addressed, we have shown that, even when quite
important down-sampling is considered, the recognition accuracy only slightly de-
grades. In any case, best accuracies are obtained when an adaptive down-sampling

is used on the end effector 3D trajectories. The temporal redundancy is therefore
high and apparently not critical for the discrimination of the selected movements
and tasks. In return, the down-sampling beneﬁts in terms of computational com-
plexity is quadratic with the reduction of the number of skeletal postures kept along
the time axis.

Furthermore, the elasticity of the kernel provides a signiﬁcant performance gain
(comparatively to kernel based on the Euclidean distance) which is very important
when the data are characterized by high variability. Our results show that a SVM
based on a regularized DTW kernel is very competitive comparatively to the state-
of-the-art methods applied on the two tested data sets, even when the dimension
reduction on the time axis is important. The down-sampling and dimensionality
reduction of the descriptor ensures that this approach meets the real-time constraint
of gesture recognition.

This study opens perspectives to the use of elastic kernels constructed from more
sophisticated time elastic distances [Marteau, 2009] that cope explicitly with time
stamped data, associated to adaptive sampling techniques such the one developed
in this paper or more sophisticated techniques capable of extracting the most sig-
niﬁcant and discriminant skeletal poses in movement sequences, based on semantic
segmentation. We also aim at testing these powerful tools to more complex tasks,
where skilled gestures are studied, or/and expressive variations are considered.
