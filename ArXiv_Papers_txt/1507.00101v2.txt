Supervised Learning of Semantics-Preserving
Hash via Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

Huei-Fang Yang, Kevin Lin, and Chu-Song Chen

Abstract—This paper presents a simple yet effective supervised deep hash approach that constructs binary hash codes from labeled
data for large-scale image search. We assume that the semantic labels are governed by several latent attributes with each attribute on
or off, and classiﬁcation relies on these attributes. Based on this assumption, our approach, dubbed supervised semantics-preserving
deep hashing (SSDH), constructs hash functions as a latent layer in a deep network and the binary codes are learned by minimizing an
objective function deﬁned over classiﬁcation error and other desirable hash codes properties. With this design, SSDH has a nice
characteristic that classiﬁcation and retrieval are uniﬁed in a single learning model. Moreover, SSDH performs joint learning of image
representations, hash codes, and classiﬁcation in a point-wised manner, and thus is scalable to large-scale datasets. SSDH is simple
and can be realized by a slight enhancement of an existing deep architecture for classiﬁcation; yet it is effective and outperforms other
hashing approaches on several benchmarks and large datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, SSDH achieves higher
retrieval accuracy, while the classiﬁcation performance is not sacriﬁced.

1 INTRODUCTION

S EMANTIC search is important

in content-based im-
age retrieval (CBIR). Hashing methods that construct
similarity-preserving binary codes for efﬁcient image search
have received great attention in CBIR [1], [2], [3]. The key
principle in devising the hash functions is to map images
of similar content to similar binary codes, which amounts
to mapping the high-dimensional visual data into a low-
dimensional Hamming (binary) space. Having done so, one
can perform an approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) search
by simply calculating the Hamming distance between bi-
nary vectors, an operation that can be done extremely fast.
Recently, learning-based hash approaches have become
popular as they leverage training samples in code construc-
tion. The learned binary codes are more efﬁcient than the
ones by locality sensitive hashing (LSH) [4] that maps simi-
lar images to the same bucket with high probability through
random projections, makes no use of training data, and thus
requires longer codes to attain high search accuracy. Among
various learning-based approaches, supervised hashing that
exploits the supervised information (e.g., pairwised similar-
ities or triple-wised rankings devised by data labels) during
the hash function construction can learn binary codes better
capturing the semantic structure of data. Though supervised
hashing approaches yield promising performance, many of
the recent techniques employ pairs or triplets of the training
samples in the learning phase and thus require a long com-
putation time and a high storage cost for training. They are
suitable for small-scale datasets but would be impractical
when the data size becomes large.

Recent advances reveal that deep convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) are capable of learning rich mid-level
representations effective for image classiﬁcation, object de-
tection, and semantic segmentation [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10].
The deep CNN architectures trained on a huge dataset of
numerous categories (e.g., ImageNet [11]) can be transferred
to new domains by employing them as feature extractors on
other tasks including recognition [12], [13] and retrieval [14],
[15], which provide better performance than handcrafted
features such as GIST [16] and HOG [17]. Moreover, the
CNN parameters pre-trained on a large-scale dataset can
be transferred and further ﬁne-tuned to perform a new task
in another domain (such as PASCAL VOC [18], Caltech-
101 [19], Oxford buildings [20]) and capture more favorable
semantic information of images [21], [22].

The success of deep CNN on classiﬁcation and detection
tasks is encouraging. It reveals that ﬁne-tuning a CNN
pre-trained on a large-scale and diverse-category dataset
provides a fairly promising way for domain adaptation and
transfer learning. For image retrieval, a question worthy of
study thus arises: Beyond classiﬁcation, is the “pre-train
+ ﬁne-tune” scheme also capable of learning binary hash
codes for efﬁcient retrieval? Besides, if it is, how to modify
the architecture of a pre-trained CNN to this end?

In this paper, to answer the question and enable efﬁcient
training with large-scale data, we take advantage of deep
learning and propose the supervised semantics-preserving
deep hashing (SSDH) for learning binary codes from labeled
images. The idea of SSDH is unsophisticated and innovated,
where we assume that image labels can be implicitly repre-
sented by a set of latent attributes (i.e., binary codes) and
the classiﬁcation is dependent on these attributes. Based on
this idea, we construct the hash functions as a hidden layer
between image representations and classiﬁcation outputs in
a CNN, and the binary codes are learned by minimizing an
objective function deﬁned over classiﬁcation error and other

desired properties on the binary codes. This design yields a
simple and effective network that uniﬁes classiﬁcation and
retrieval in a single learning process and enforces semanti-
cally similar images to have similar binary codes.

Moreover, to make the outputs of each hidden node close
to 0 or 1 and the resulting hash codes more separated, we
impose additional constraints on the learning objective to
make each hash bit carry as much information as possi-
ble and more discriminative. During network learning, we
transfer the parameters of the pre-trained network to SSDH
and ﬁne-tune SSDH on the target domains for efﬁcient
retrieval. An overview of our approach is given in Figure 1.
Our method can exploit existing well-performed deep
convolution networks and provide an easy way to enhance
them. Only a lightweight modiﬁcation has been made on
the architecture to achieve simultaneous classiﬁcation and
retrieval, and we show that the classiﬁcation performance
will not be sacriﬁced when our modiﬁcation is applied.
Main contributions of this paper include:
Unifying retrieval and classiﬁcation: SSDH is a supervised
hash approach that takes advantage of deep learning, uniﬁes
classiﬁcation and retrieval in a single learning model, and
jointly learns representations, hash functions, and classiﬁca-
tion from image data.
Scalable deep hash: SSDH performs learning in a point-
wised manner, and thereby requires neither pairs nor
triplets of training inputs. This characteristic makes it more
scalable to large-scale data learning and retrieval.
Lightweight deep hash: SSDH is established upon the
effective deep architecture and parameters pre-trained for
classiﬁcation; it can beneﬁt from supervised deep transfer
learning and is easily realizable by a slight enhancement of
an existing deep classiﬁcation network.

We conduct extensive experiments on several bench-
marks and also some large collections of more than 1 million
images. Experimental results show that our method is sim-
ple but powerful, and can easily generate more favorable
results than existing state-of-the-art hash function learning
methods. This paper is an extended version of [23], [24].

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Learning-based Hash
Learning-based hash algorithms construct hash codes by
leveraging the training data and are expected to over-
come the limitations of data-independent methods in the
LSH family [4], [25]. The learning-based approaches can be
grouped into three categories according to the degree of
supervised information of labeled data used: unsupervised,
semi-supervised, and supervised methods.

Unsupervised algorithms [1], [3], [26], [27] use unlabeled
data for code construction and try to preserve the simi-
larity between data examples in the original space (e.g.,
the Euclidean space). Representative methods include spec-
tral hashing (SH) [27], kernelized locality-sensitive hashing
(KLSH) [3], and iterative quantization (ITQ) [1].

Semi-supervised algorithms [28], [29], [30] use informa-
tion from both labeled and unlabeled samples for learning
hash functions. For example, the SSH [29] minimizes the
empirical error on the pairwise labeled data (e.g., similar
and dissimilar data pairs) and maximizes the variance of

Fig. 1. An overview of our proposed supervised semantic-preserving
deep hashing (SSDH) that takes AlexNet as an example. We construct
the hash functions as a latent layer with K units between the image
representation layer and classiﬁcation outputs in a convolutional neural
network (CNN). SSDH takes inputs from images and learns image rep-
resentations, binary codes, and classiﬁcation through the optimization of
an objective function that combines a classiﬁcation loss with desirable
properties of hash codes. The learned codes preserve the semantic
similarity between images and are compact for image search.

hash codes. The semi-supervised tag hashing (SSTH) [30]
models the correlation between the hash codes and the class
labels in a supervised manner and preserves the similarity
between image examples in an unsupervised manner.

Supervised hashing approaches [31], [32], [33], [34], [35],
[36], [37], [38] aim to fully take advantage of the super-
vised information of labeled data for learning more efﬁcient
binary representations, therefore attaining higher search
accuracy than the unsupervised and the semi-supervised
approaches. Utilizing pairwise relations between data sam-
ples, binary reconstructive embedding (BRE) [31] mini-
mizes the squared error between the original Euclidean
distances and the Hamming distances of binary codes, and
the same/different labels information can be integrated in
the training scheme for supervision. Minimal loss hashing
(MLH) [35] minimizes the empirical
loss for code con-
struction. Ranking-based methods [36], [38] that leverage
the ranking information from a set of triplets have also
been proposed. Methods that rely on pairs or triplets of
image samples for training generally need a high storage
cost and are infeasible for large datasets. Learning binary
codes in a point-wised manner would be a better alternative
for the scalability of hash. Point-wise methods use the
provided label information to guide the learning of hash
functions. Iterative quantization with canonical correlation
analysis (CCA-ITQ) [1] applies CCA with label information
for dimensionality reduction and then performs binarization
through minimizing the quantization error. The supervised
discrete hashing (SDH) [37] formulates the learning of hash
codes in terms of classiﬁcation in order to learn binary codes
optimal for classiﬁcation. While SDH and ours share similar
spirits on coupling hash code learning and classiﬁcation,
SDH decomposes the hashing learning into sub-problems
and needs a careful choice of loss function for classiﬁcation
to make the entire optimization efﬁcient and scalable. Our
formulation on the deep networks simpliﬁes the optimiza-
tion process and is naturally scalable to large-scale datasets.
In the learning-based hashing approaches, methods
based on deep networks [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]
form a special group and so we discuss them separately

here. One of the earliest efforts to apply deep networks
in hash is semantic hashing (SH) [42]. It constructs hash
codes from unlabeled images via a network with stacked
Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). The learned binary
codes are treated as memory addresses, and thus similar
items to a query can be found by simply accessing to mem-
ory addresses that are within a Hamming ball around the
query vector. Autoencoders, which aim to learn compressed
representations of data, can be used to map images to binary
codes. The deep autoencoder developed in [39] is initialized
with the weights from pre-trained stacks of RBMs, and
the code layer uses logistic units whose outputs then are
rounded to 1 or 0 for binary codes.

Deep networks are also used in deep hashing (DH)
and supervised DH (SDH) [41] for learning compact binary
codes through seeking multiple non-linear projections to
map samples into binary codes. Deep multi-view hashing
(DMVH) [45] constructs a network with view-speciﬁc and
shared hidden units to handle multi-view data. However,
these methods rely on hand-crafted features, which need
strong prior to design beforehand and do not evolve along
the code learning. Our SSDH, by contrast, couples feature
learning and code construction in a single model. Under the
semantics supervision, both of them evolve into a feature
space where semantically similar contents tend to share
similar codes. Recently, hashing methods based on CNNs
have also been proposed. CNNH and CNNH+ [43] em-
ploy a two-stage learning approach that ﬁrst decomposes
a pairwise similarity matrix into approximate hash codes
based on data labels and then trains a CNN for learning
the hash functions. The method in [40] and deep semantic
ranking based hashing (DSRH) [44] adopt a triplet ranking
loss derived from labels for code construction. Like these
approaches, our method also exploits label information in
code learning. However, ours differs from them in several
ways. First, our SSDH imposes additional constraints on the
latent layer to learn more separated codes while no such
constraints are applied in [40], [44]. Second, ours can be
achieved by a slight modiﬁcation to an existing network
while [40] requires a more complex network conﬁguration
with signiﬁcant modiﬁcations. Finally, our approach learns
in a point-wised manner but some of these approaches need
to perform a matrix factorization prior to hash function
learning (e.g., CNNH and CNNH+ [43]) and some need to
take inputs in the form of image pairs (e.g., SDH [41]) or
image triples (e.g., [40] and DSRH [44]), which make them
less favorable when the data size is large.

2.2 Supervised Deep Transfer Learning
In deep learning, the networks can be pre-trained in an
unsupervised way based on an energy-based probability
model in RBM and deep belief networks [46], or via self-
reproducing in autoencoders [39]. Then, followed by super-
vised training (i.e., ﬁne-tuning) the network can be opti-
mized for a particular task.

Pre-training has been pushed forward to supervised
learning recently. Supervised pre-training and ﬁne-tuning
has been employed in CNN and shown promising per-
formance. It follows the inductive transfer learning princi-
ple [47], which adopts the idea that one cannot learn how

to walk before crawl, or how to run before walk. Hence,
the connection strengths trained from one or more tasks
for a neural network can be used as initial conditions
and further adapted to suit new and/or higher-level tasks
in other domains. Supervised pre-training investigated in
DeCAF [12] shows that a deep CNN pre-trained with su-
pervision on the ImageNet dataset [48] can be used as a
feature extractor. The obtained deep convolutional features
are effective for other visual tasks, such as scene classiﬁca-
tion, domain adaptation, and ﬁne-grained recognition. The
capacity of deep representations is investigated in [13], in
which mid-level representations of a pre-trained CNN are
transferred and two adaptation layers are added to the top
of deep features for learning a new task. The work shows
that transfer learning can be achieved with only limited
amount of training data. Unlike [13] where the ﬁne-tune
is only performed in the additional layers for classiﬁcation,
the Region-based Convolutional Network (R-CNN) [8], [21]
ﬁne-tunes the entire network for domain-speciﬁc tasks of
object detection and segmentation.

Besides, such deep features have recently gained much
attention in image retrieval as well. As shown in Krizhevsky
et al. [5], the features of CNNs learned on large data can
be used for retrieval. Since then, deep features have been
widely adopted in image search. For example, the work
in [15] has extensively evaluated the performance of deep
features as a global descriptor. Gong et al. [49] propose
to use Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD)
to pool deep features of local patches at multiple scales.
Babenko and Lempitsky [50] suggest a sum-pooling aggre-
gation method to generate compact global descriptors from
local deep features, and the work in [14] studies the spatial
search strategy to improve retrieval performance.

How to exploit the strength of supervised deep transfer
learning for hash function construction has not been ex-
plored yet. In this paper, instead of performing inductive
transfer learning merely for the purpose of task domain
conversions, we further investigate the adaptation problem
in the functionality level. The proposed approach ﬁne-tunes
the weights to a new domain for classiﬁcation and also
realizes a function-level tuning to generate semantic-aware
binary codes. Our approach relies on an enhancement of
existing classiﬁcation architectures, and we show that the
classiﬁcation performance will not be degraded experimen-
tally. It thus provides a multi-purpose architecture effective
for both retrieval and classiﬁcation.
3 LEARNING HASH CODES VIA DEEP NETWORKS
Let I = {In}N
be their associated label vectors, where M denotes the
total number of class labels. An entry of the vector yn is
1 if an image In belongs to the corresponding class and
0 otherwise. Our goal is to learn a mapping F : I →
{0, 1}K×N , which maps images to their K-bits binary codes
B = {bn} ∈ {0, 1}K×N while preserving the semantic
similarity between image data. Speciﬁcally, we aim to design
a supervised hashing algorithm that exploits the semantic
labels to create binary codes of the following properties:
• The codes respect the semantic similarity between image
labels. Images that share common class labels are mapped
to same (or close) binary codes.

n=1 be N images and Y = (cid:8)yn ∈ {0, 1}M(cid:9)N

• The bits in a code are evenly distributed and discrimina-

tive.

3.1 Deep Hashing Functions
We take advantage of recent advances in deep learning
and construct the hash functions on a CNN that is capable
of learning semantic representations from images. Our ap-
proach is based on existing deep models, such as AlexNet [5]
and VGG [6]. It can be integrated with other deep models as
well. Without loss of generality, we introduce our approach
based on AlexNet in the following.

The architecture of AlexNet is illustrated in the top half
of Figure 1. It has 5 convolution layers (F1−5) with max-
pooling operations followed by 2 fully connected layers
(F6−7) and an output layer. In the convolutional layers, units
are organized into feature maps and are connected locally
to patches in the outputs (i.e., feature maps) of the previous
layer. The fully-connected layers can be viewed as a classi-
ﬁer when the task is to recognize images. The convolution
and ﬁrst two fully-connected layers (F6−7) are composed of
the rectiﬁed linear units (ReLUs) because the ReLUs lead to
faster training. AlexNet is designed in particular for multi-
class classiﬁcation problems so that its output layer is a clas-
siﬁcation layer have the units of the same number of class
labels. The output units are with the softmax functions and
the network is trained to maximize the multinomial logistic
regression objective function for multi-class classiﬁcation. To
incorporate the deep representations into the hash function
learning, we add a latent layer H with K units to the top
of layer F7 (i.e., the layer right before the output layer), as
illustrated in the bottom half of Figure 1. This latent layer is
fully connected to F7 and uses the sigmoid units so that the
activations are between 0 and 1.
Let W H ∈ Rd×K denote the weights (i.e. the projec-
tion matrix) between F7 and the latent layer. For a given
n ∈ Rd in layer F7,
image In with the feature vector a7
the activations of the units in H can be computed as
aH
n = σ(a7
n is a K-dimensional vector,
bH is the bias term and σ(· ) is the logistic sigmoid function,
deﬁned by σ(z) = 1/(1 + exp(−z)), with z a real value. The
binary encoding function is given by

nW H + bH ), where aH

bn = (sgn(σ(a7

nW H + bH ) − 0.5) + 1)/2

n − 0.5) + 1)/2,

= (sgn(aH

(1)
where sgn(v) = 1 if v > 0 and −1 otherwise, and sgn(· )
performs element-wise operations for a matrix or a vector.

3.2 Label Consistent Binary Codes
Image labels not only provide knowledge in classifying
images but also are useful supervised information for learn-
ing hash functions. We propose to model the relationship
between the labels and the binary codes in order to con-
struct semantics-preserving binary codes. We assume that
the semantic labels can be derived from a set of K latent
concepts (or hidden attributes) with each attribute on or
off. When an input image is associated with binary-valued
outputs (in {0, 1}K), the classiﬁcation is dependent on these
hidden attributes. This implies that through an optimization
of a loss function deﬁned on the classiﬁcation error, we

4

can ensure that semantically similar images are mapped to
similar binary codes.
Consider a matrix W C ∈ RK×M that performs a linear
mapping of the binary hidden attributes to the class labels.
Incorporating such a matrix into our the network amounts
to adding a classiﬁcation layer to the top of the latent layer
(see Figure 1 where the black dashed lines denote W C). Let
ˆyn denote the prediction of our network (the black nodes
in Figure 1) for an image In. In terms of the classiﬁcation
formulation, to solve W C, one can choose to optimize the
following objective function:

L(yn, ˆyn) + λ||W||2,

W

W

arg min

E1(W ) = arg min

(2)
where L(· ) is a loss function that minimizes classiﬁcation
error and will be detailed below, W denotes the weights of
the network, and λ governs the relative importance of the
regularization term.

n=1

The choice of the loss function depends on the problem
itself. For multi-class classiﬁcation, we simply follow the
setting in AlexNet that uses softmax outputs and minimizes
the cross-entropy error function:

N(cid:88)

L(yn, ˆyn) = − M(cid:88)

m=1

ynmlnˆynm,

(3)

where ynm and ˆynm are the desired output and the predic-
tion of the mth unit, respectively.

We introduce a maximum-margin loss function to fulﬁll
the goal of multi-label classiﬁcation because the loss func-
tion in AlexNet is designed only for the single-label pur-
pose. Following the same notions, let Y = {ynm}N×M de-
note the label vectors associated with N images of M class
labels. In multi-label classiﬁcation, an image is associated
with multiple classes and thus multiple entries of yn could
be 1, and the outputs in our network are m = {1,··· M}
binary classiﬁers. Given the n-th image sample with the
label ynm, we want the m-th output node of the network
to have positive response for the desired label ynm = 1
(i.e., positive sample) and negative response for ynm = 0
(i.e., negative sample). In speciﬁc, to enlarge the margin of
the classiﬁcation boundary, for samples of a particular label
ynm, we set the network to have the outputs ˆynm ≥ 1 for
ynm = 1 and ˆynm ≤ 0 for ynm = 0. The loss l(ynm, ˆynm) for
each output node is deﬁned as

ynm = 1 ∧ ˆynm ≥ 1
ynm = 0 ∧ ˆynm ≤ 0

,

l(ynm, ˆynm) =

2|ynm − ˆynm|p

p otherwise

(4)
where p ∈ {1, 2}. When p = 1 (or 2), such a loss function
actually implements linear L1-norm (or L2-norm) support
vector machine (SVM) [51] thresholded at 0.5. Hence, our
network combines the AlexNet architecture, binary latent
layer, and SVM classiﬁers in a cascade for multi-label clas-
siﬁcation. Note that to train a large scale linear SVM, the
state-of-the-art methods [51], [52] employ the coordinate-
descent optimization in the dual domain (DCD) of SVM,
which is proven to be equivalent to performing stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) in the primal domain [51]. As SGD
is a standard procedure for training neural networks, when

M(cid:88)

our network is trained only for the SVM layer and the
parameters of the other layers are ﬁxed, it is equivalent to
solving the convex quadratic programming problem of SVM
by using the primal domain SGD method in [51], [52] (with
SGD’s learning rate corresponding to some SVM’s model
parameter C). When training the entire network, the param-
eters then evolve to more favorable feature representations
(in the AlexNet architecture), latent binary representations
(in the hidden layer), and binary classiﬁers (in the SVMs
layer) simultaneously. The gradient with the activation of
output unit m, ∂l(ynm,ˆynm)

, takes the form

∂ ˆynm

ynm = 1 ∧ ˆynm ≥ 1
ynm = 0 ∧ ˆynm ≤ 0

,

(5)
for p = 1 or 2. Because the loss function is almost differen-
tiable everywhere, it is suitable for gradient-based optimiza-
tion methods. Finally, the loss function L(yn, ˆyn) is deﬁned
as the summation of the losses of output units,

3.3 Efﬁcient Binary Codes
Apart from that semantically similar images have similar
binary codes, we encourage the activation of each latent
node to approximate to {0, 1}. Let aH
nk (k = 1,··· , K) be
the k-th element of the hidden vector aH
nk has
already been activated by a sigmoid function, its value is
inside the range [0,1]. To further make the codes approach
to either 0 or 1, it can be achieved by adding the constraint
of maximizing the sum of squared errors between the latent-
n − 0.5e||2, where
e is the K-dimensional vector with all elements 1. With this
constraint, the codes generated by our network can fulﬁll
the binary-valued requirement more appropriately.

Besides making the codes binarized, we consider further
the balance property. This could be achieved by letting 50%
of the values in the training samples {aH
n=1 be 0 and the
other 50% be 1 for each bit k as suggested in [27]. However,
because all of the training data are jointly involved to fulﬁll
this constraint, it is difﬁcult to be implemented in mini-
batches when SGD is applied for the optimization.

In this paper, we want to keep the constraints decom-
posable to sample-wised terms so that they are realizable
with SGD in a point-wised way. To make the binary codes
balanced, we consider a different constraint implementable
with mini-batches. Given an image In, let {aH
k=1 form a
discrete probability distribution over {0, 1}. We hope that
there is no preference for the hidden values to be 0 or 1.
That is, the occurrence probability of each bit’s on or off
is the same, or the entropy of the discrete distribution is
maximized. To this end, we want each bit to ﬁre 50% of

mean(· ) computes the average of the elements in a vector.
The criterion thus favors binary codes with an equal number
of 0’s and 1’s in the learning objective. It also enlarges the
minimal gap and makes the codes more separated because

the minimal Hamming distance between two binary strings
with the same amounts of 0’s and 1’s is 2 (but not 1).
In sum, combining these two constraints makes aH

n close
to a length-K binary string with a 50% chance of each bit
being 0 or 1, and we aim to optimize the following objective
to obtain the binary codes:

where p ∈ {1, 2}. The ﬁrst term encourages the activations
of the units in H to be close to either 0 or 1, and the second
term further ensures that the output of each node has a
nearly 50% chance of being 0 or 1. Note that the objective
designed in Eq. (7) remains a sum-of-losses form. It keeps
the property that each loss term is contributed by only an
individual training sample and no cross-sample terms are
involved in the loss function. Hence, the objective remains
point-wised and can be minimized through SGD efﬁciently
by dividing the training samples (but not pairs or triples
of them) into batches. Our network thus relies on the min-
imization of a latent-concept-driven classiﬁcation objective
with some sufﬁcient conditions on the latent codes to learn
semantic-aware binary representations, which can be shown
fairly effective on various datasets in our experiments.

On the network design, we add a unit (the green node
in the bottom half of Figure 1) that performs an average
pooling operation (the green dashed lines) over the nodes in
the latent layer to obtain the mean activation for the E3(· )
term in Eq. (7). The weights associated with the connections
to this unit are ﬁxed to 1/K. The E2(· ) term in Eq. (7)
imposes constraints directly on the units in the latent layer.
No modiﬁcation to the network is needed. However, for
the clarity of presentation, we draw additional red nodes

3.4 Overall Objective and Implementation
The entire objective function aiming for constructing simi-
larity preserving (E1(W ) in Eq. (2)) and binarization prop-
erties (Eq. (7)) is given as:

arg min

W

αE1(W ) − βE2(W ) + γE3(W ),

(8)

where α, β, and γ are the weights of each term.

We implement our approach by using the open source
CAFFE [53] package with an NVIDIA Titan X GPU. To op-
timize (8), in addition to the output layer for classiﬁcation,
we add two new loss layers for E2 and E3, respectively, on
top of the latent layer. When performing multi-label clas-
siﬁcation, the output layer is replaced with the maximum-
margin loss layer in our implementation. As our network
is adapted from AlexNet [5] that has been trained on the
1.2 million ILSVRC subset of the ImageNet for the 1000-
class recognition task, the initial weights in layers F1−7
of our network are set as the pre-trained ones and the
remaining weights are randomly initialized. We apply SGD,
in conjunction with backpropagation, with mini-batches to
network training for minimizing the overall objective in
Eq. (8). We also employ dropout in which the activations

4.1 Evaluation Protocols
We use three evaluation metrics widely adopted in the lit-
erature for the performance comparison. They measure the
performance of hashing algorithms from different aspects.
• Mean average precision (mAP): We rank all the images
according to their Hamming distances to the query and
compute the mAP. The mAP computes the area under the
recall-precision curve and is an indicator of the overall
performance of hash functions;

• Precision at k samples: It is computed as the percentage

of true neighbors among the top k retrieved images;

• Precision within Hamming radius r: We compute the
precision of the images in the buckets that fall within the
Hamming radius r of the query image, where r = 2 is
selected as previous works did.

Following the common settings of evaluating the perfor-
mance of hash methods, we use the class labels as the
ground truth and all the above three metrics are computed
through examining whether the returned images and the
query share a common class label. For the datasets lacking
of class labels, the performance is evaluated via the ground-
truth retrieval lists provided for the queries in their test sets.

4.2 Datasets
CIFAR-10 [54] is a dataset consists of 60,000 32 × 32 color
images categorized into 10 classes. The class labels are mu-
tually exclusive, and thus each class has 6,000 images. The
entire dataset is partitioned into two non-overlapping sets:
a training set with 50,000 images and a test set with 10,000
images. Following the settings in [40], [43], we randomly
sampled 1,000 images, 100 images per class, from the test set
to form the query set for performance evaluation. CIFAR-10
is one of the most commonly used datasets for evaluating
hash-based image retrieval approaches.
NUS-WIDE [55] is a dataset comprising about 270,000 im-
ages collected from Flickr. Each image belongs to more than
one category taken from 81 concept tags. The NUS-WIDE
website provides only the URLs of images, and following

Fig. 2. Binary codes for retrieval. Images are fed to the network, and their
corresponding binary codes are obtained by binarizing the activations of
the latent layer. For image retrieval, the binary codes of a query and
of every image in the database are compared based on the Hamming
distance. The images closest to the query are returned as the results.

of the intermediate units are set to zero with a probability
of 0.5 during training in order to avoid over-ﬁtting. The
parameters α, β, and γ are evaluated on a dataset at ﬁrst,
and then all are set as 1 in our experiments. Our model is a
lightweight modiﬁcation of an existing network and thus is
easy to implement. The codes are publicly available1.
Relation to “AlexNet feature + LSH”: The relationship
between our approach and an naive combination, AlexNet
feature + LSH is worth a mention. Because random Gaus-
sian weights are used for initializing the weights between
F7 and the latent layer, our network can be regarded as
initialized with LSH (i.e., random weights) to map the
deep features learned in ImageNet (AlexNet feature) to
binary codes. Through SGD learning, the weights of the pre-
trained, latent, and classiﬁcation layers evolve a multi-layer
function more suitable for the new domain. Compared to
the straightforward combination of AlexNet features and
LSH, our approach can obtain more favorable results as
demonstrated in the experiments in Section 4.

3.5 Binary Codes for Retrieval
Figure 2 illustrates the scheme used to extract binary codes
and retrieve similar images for a query. First, images are
fed to the network, and the activations of the latent layer
are extracted. Then, the binary codes are obtained by quan-
tizing the extracted activations via Eq. (1). Similar images
to a novel query are found by computing the Hamming
distances between the binary codes of the query and the
database images and selecting the images with small Ham-
ming distances in the database as retrieval results.

4 EXPERIMENTS
We conduct experiments on several benchmarks to compare
our method with the state-of-the-art methods. We also apply
our method to large datasets containing more than 1 million
images to show its scalability. The images in the datasets are
in a wide spectrum of image types including tiny objects
of CIFAR-10, web images of NUS-WIDE, handwritten digits
of MNIST, catalog images of UT-ZAP50K, as well as scene
images of SUN397, Oxford, and Paris. The large datasets,
Yahoo-1M and ILSVRC, comprise product and object im-
ages with heterogeneous types, respectively. The evaluation
protocols and datasets are summarized as follows.

the given links, we were able to collect about 230,000 images
as the other images have been removed by the owners.
Following the settings in [40], [43], we use images in the
21 most frequent labels, with at least 5,000 images per label,
in the evaluation. The downloaded images are divided into
a training set of 97,214 images and a test set of 65,075
images. The training set is used for network training, and
in accordance with the evaluation protocols used in [40],
[43], 100 images per label are randomly sampled from the
test set to form a query set of 2,100 images.
MNIST is a dataset of 70,000 28 × 28 grayscale images
of handwritten digits grouped into 10 classes. It comprises
60,000 training and 10,000 testing images.
SUN397 [56] is a large scene dataset consisting of 108,754
images in 397 categories. The number of images varies
across categories, with each category containing at least 100
images. Following the settings in [33], we randomly select
8,000 images to form the query set and use the remaining
100,754 as the training samples.
UT-ZAP50K [57] consists of 50,025 catalog images collected
from Zappos.com. Some selected images are shown in Fig-
ure 3. This dataset is created for ﬁne-grained visual com-
parisons on a shopping task. To use it in a retrieval task,
we associate images with multiple labels from 8 selected
classes (4 categories (boots, sandals, shoes, and slippers)
and 4 gender labels (boys, girls, men, and women)). We
randomly select 8,000 images, 1,000 per class, as the test
set and use the remaining images (42,025) for training.
Yahoo-1M Shopping Images contains 1,124,086 product
images of heterogeneous types collected from the Yahoo
shopping sites. The images are of cluttered backgrounds or
backgroundless, with or without humans. Figure 3 shows
some selected images. Each image is associated with a class
label, and there are 116 classes in total. The number of
images in each class varies greatly, ranging from 1,007 to
150,211. To divide the dataset into two sets, we selected
90% of the images from each class as training samples and
the rest 10% as test samples. The entire dataset is thus
partitioned into a training set of 1,011,723 images and a test
set of 112,363 images.
ILSVRC2012 [11] is the dataset for the ImageNet Large Scale
Visual Recognition Challenge, and also the dataset used for
pre-raining the AlexNet and VGG network models available
on CAFFE. It has 1,000 object classes with approximately
1.2 million training images, 50,000 validation images, and
100,000 test images. Each image contains a salient object,
and the objects in this dataset tend to be centered in the
images. We use the training set for network learning and
employ the validation set as the query in the evaluation.
Paris [58] is a standard benchmark for instance-level image
retrieval. It includes 6,412 images of Paris landmarks. The
performance of retrieval algorithms is measured based on
the mAP of 55 queries.
Oxford [20] is another widely used benchmark for instance-
level image retrieval. It consists of 5,062 images correspond-
ing to 11 Oxford landmarks. Images are with considerable
variations in viewpoints and scales, thereby making Oxford
a more challenging dataset than Paris. Like Paris, 55 queries
(5 per landmark) are used for performance evaluation.

Information of these datasets can be found in Table 1.
Note that our network takes ﬁxed-sized image inputs. Im-

ages of all datasets are normalized to 256 × 256 and then
center-cropped to 227 × 227 as inputs to AlexNet and
224 × 224 to VGG, respectively, following the associated
models that are pre-trained and available on CAFFE. Unless
otherwise mentioned, the results are conducted by using our
SSDH on the AlexNet architecture.

4.3 Retrieval Results on CIFAR-10
We compare SSDH with several hashing methods, including
unsupervised methods (LSH [4], ITQ [1], and SH [27]) and
supervised approaches (BRE [31], MLH [35], CCA-ITQ [1],
CNNH+ [43], CNNH [43], and Lai et al. [40]). In the exper-
iments, we use SSDH of the squared losses (i.e. p = 2) in
Eq. (7), and the parameters α, β, γ in Eq. (8) are all set as
1. Among the six supervised approaches, CNNH+, CNNH,
and Lai et al., like our approach, take advantage of deep
learning techniques and supervised label information.

Following the settings in [40], Figure 4a shows the results
based on the mAP as a function of code length. Among
various methods compared, it can be observed that the
supervised approaches constantly outperform the unsuper-
vised ones, LSH [4], ITQ [1] and SH [27]. Besides, the deep
learning-based approaches in [40], [43] and ours achieve
relatively better performance, and this could be attributed to
the fact that deep networks enable joint learning of feature
representations and binary functions directly from images,
and the learned feature representations are more effective
than the hand-engineered ones such as 512-dimensional
GIST features used in BRE [31], MLH [35], and CCA-ITQ [1].
Referring to the results, SSDH provides stable and the
most favorable performance for different code lengths, and
improves the mAP by a margin of around 34% compared
with the competitive methods. The results suggest that uni-
fying retrieval and classiﬁcation in a single learning model
where the hash code learning is governed by the semantic
labels can better capture the semantic information in im-
ages and hence yields more favorable performance. Besides,
compared to SDH [41] that uses a different setting of 12-,
32-, and 64-bit codes that cannot be shown in the ﬁgure, the
mAP obtained by our 12-bit SSDH is still much higher than
46.75%, 51.01%, and 52.50%, respectively obtained in [41].

Figure 4b shows the precision at k samples, where
k ranges from 100 to 1,000, when the 48-bit hash codes
are used in the evaluation. These curves convey similar
messages as observed in the mAP measure. SSDH has a
consistent advantage over other hashing methods, and the
approaches (ours, Lai et al., CNNH+, CNNH, and CCA-
ITQ) that exploit the label information in learning hash
functions perform better than those that do not.

The evaluation of the precision within Hamming radius
2 is shown in Figure 4c. Our approach performs more favor-
ably against the others on this metric too. As it is unclear
what is the suitable value of r for different tasks and code
lengths, we consider the previous two evaluation metrics,
mAP and precision at k samples, would reﬂect the retrieval
performance better than this metric in general. Here, we use
r = 2 simply for following the conventions of performance
comparison.

As our network is enhanced from a classiﬁcation net-
work, it is worth noting whether the classiﬁcation per-
formance is still maintained. To verify this and for a fair

comparison, we ﬁne-tune the original AlexNet (i.e., the
model without a latent layer added), initialized with the
features trained on ImageNet, on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The AlexNet+ﬁne-tune achieves the classiﬁcation accuracy
of 89.28% and our SSDH architecture (with a latent layer)
attains the accuracies of 89.74%, 89.87% and 89.89% for the
code lengths 12, 32 and 48, respectively. It reveals that stable
classiﬁcation performance is still accomplished by using our
architecture. More classiﬁcation results for all of the single-
labeled datasets can be found in Section 4.13.

We also study the inﬂuence of individual terms in the
learning objective (with p = 2 in Eq. (7)). The loss of
SSDH in Eq. (8) consists of three terms encouraging label
consistency, binarization, and equal sparsity of the codes.
First, we use only the two terms E1 and E2 by ﬁxing
the ﬁrst weight α as 1, varying the second weight β in
{0, 20, 21, 22, 23}, and setting the third weight γ as 0. Ta-
ble 2a shows the mAPs of SSDH with 48-bit codes on the
CIFAR-10 dataset. It can be seen that the mAPs obtained
are roughly around 90%. Among them, β ∈ {0, 20, 21}
get higher mAPs. It reﬂects that a moderate level of bi-

narization is helpful to binary codes learning. We further
study the case of adding the third term E3 with α = 1,
β ∈ {0, 20, 21}, and γ ∈ {0, 20, 21, 22, 23}, as shown in
Table 2b. As can be seen, adding the equal-sparsity term
(E3) can possibly increase the performance too, and the
equal weights α = β = γ = 1 get the highest mAP among
all the situations studied. Compare the cases where each
term is getting added, {α, β, γ} = {1, 0, 0}, {1, 1, 0}, and
{1, 1, 1}. The mAPs respectively obtained, 90.70%, 91.19%,
and 91.45%, are getting increased. Hence, using all the
terms is beneﬁcial to achieving more favorable retrieval
performance. In the following, we simply choose the naive
combination {α, β, γ} = {1, 1, 1} in Eq. (8) for all of the
other experiments and comparisons.

Besides, we study the impacts of different functions on
the performance by further using the L1-norm loss (p = 1)
in Eq. (7) and present empirical results in Table 3. We see
that L1- and L2-norm losses attain comparable retrieval per-
formance, indicating that our learning objective can provide
stable results with different losses employed for learning
binary codes. Unless otherwise mentioned, we use p = 2 in

4.4 Retrieval Results on MNIST
MNIST is a relatively simpler dataset
than CIFAR10.
Though many methods can get fairly good performance
on the dataset, we show that the performance can still
be improved by SSDH. Figure 5 shows the comparison of
different hashing methods on MNIST. We see that these
results accord with our observations in CIFAR-10 that SSDH
performs more favorably against other supervised and un-
supervised approaches.

We also report the classiﬁcation performance for this
single-labeled dataset. The AlexNet+ﬁne-tune achieves the
classiﬁcation accuracy of 99.39% and our SSDH achieves
99.40%, 99.34% and 99.33% for the code lengths 12, 32 and
48, respectively. This shows again that our architecture can
retain similar performance for the classiﬁcation task under
the situation that lower dimensional features (from 4096-d
to 12/32/48-d) are extracted.

Besides, following CIFAR-10, we also study the effects
of different loss functions in Eq. (7). The results reported in
Table 3 show that the performance of p = 1 is on a par with
that of p = 2, conﬁrming again that both L1- and L2-norms
in Eq. (7) are capable of learning good codes.

4.5 Retrieval Results on NUS-WIDE
SSDH is also compared with several unsupervised and
supervised approaches on NUS-WIDE, similar to the evalu-
ation done on CIFAR-10. As the web images in NUS-WIDE
are associated with more than one label, SSDH is trained
to optimize the proposed maximum-margin loss in Eq. (4)
for classiﬁcation along with the two other terms for efﬁcient
binary codes construction.

Following also the settings of [40], the comparisons
of various approaches are shown in Figure 6, where the
relevance of the retrieved image and the query image is
veriﬁed by whether they share at least one common label.
Like the results in CIFAR-10 and MNIST, the performance
of supervised and deep approaches are better than non-
supervised and non-deep approaches. Our SSDH produces
constantly better results than the other approaches when the
performance is evaluated according to the mAP of top 5,000
returned images and the precision at k samples for k = 100

Fig. 7. Precision curves with respect to different number of top retrieved
samples on the SUN397 dataset. The number inside parentheses indi-
cates the code length.

to 1,000. The improvement SSDH obtains over the previous
state-of-the-art results in mAPs is about 16% (Figure 6a) and
in precision at k samples (Figure 6b) is about 16%.

When evaluated by the precision within Hamming ra-
dius 2, SSDH also provides better results. As discussed in
the results of CIFAR-10, this metric would not reﬂect the
performance properly when the code length is long. As can
be seen, the performance on this metric drops for longer
codes in our method, which could reﬂect that our method
can balance the semantic information captured by the bits.
In sum, the results are consistent with those of CIFAR-
10 and MNIST, suggesting that SSDH is a general network
that can deal with images associated with multiple labels
or with a single label. We also study the impact of using
L1 margin (p = 1) in implementing the maximum-margin
loss of Eq. (4). The comparison in Table 4 indicates that the
retrieval performance of L2 margin is greatly better than
that of L1 margin. This would be because the gradients in L2
margin depend on the distances between misclassiﬁed sam-
ples to the true labels, allowing a network to easily correct
misclassiﬁed samples, but the gradients of L1 margin (either
1 or −1) are irrespective of the distances between them,
perhaps leading to inferior performance. Note that though
using L1 margin degrades the performance, our approach
still obtains better results than the previously competitive
method [40] that achieves mAPs of 67.4%, 71.3%, and 71.5%
for 12, 32, and 48 bits, respectively.

4.6 Retrieval Results on SUN397
SUN397 comprises more than 100,000 images in 397 scene
is more challenging than CIFAR-10 and
categories.

MNIST. Following the settings in [33], we choose the code
length as 1024 bits for comparison. Figure 7 compares SSDH,
FastHash [33], CCA-ITQ, ITQ, and LSH based on the pre-
cision at different number of top returned images. SSDH
performs better than the other approaches regardless of the
number of top returned images. In addition, the advantage
is more remarkable when a small number of top returned
images are needed. When only the top 200 returned images
are considered, SSDH outperforms FastHash by a margin of
30% precision. Thus, even for the case when code sizes are
large, SSDH achieves state-of-the-art hash-based retrieval
performance. We also apply SSDH to the dataset when the
code lengths are 128 and 48 bits and obtain precision curves
close to that of SSDH with 1024 bits. The result shows that
the performance of our approach still keeps good even when
the codes are far shorter than the number of classes, 397.

The results are obtained using the pre-trained weights
on ImageNet that contains object-based images. Because
SUN397 contains mainly scene-based images, the perfor-
mance is likely to be boosted by using the initial weights
pre-trained on another big dataset, Places dataset [59]. How-
ever, to coincide with the other experiments, we report the
results initialized by the ImageNet pre-trained weights here.
We also implement the ﬁne-tuned AlexNet for the com-
parison of the classiﬁcation performance. The ﬁne-tuned
AlexNet achieves a classiﬁcation accuracy of 52.53% that is
moderately better than the result (42.61%) reported in [59]
which uses AlexNet features without ﬁne-tuning. Our SSDH
achieves classiﬁcation accuracies of 53.86%, 53.24% and
49.55% when code lengths are 1024, 128, and 48, respec-
tively, revealing again that the classiﬁcation performance is
maintained in our architectural enhancement.

4.7 Retrieval Results on Yahoo-1M Dataset
Yahoo-1M is a single-labeled large-scale dataset. Hashing
approaches that require pair- or triple-wised inputs for

samples on the UT-ZAP50K dataset when the 48-bit hash codes are

of AlexNet ﬁne-tuned on UT-ZAP50K are used in learning hash codes.

learning binary codes are unsuitable for end-to-end learning
on Yahoo-1M due to the large time and storage complexities.
We hence compare SSDH with point-wised methods that are
applicable to such a large dataset. We ﬁne-tune AlexNet on
Yahoo-1M and then apply LSH, ITQ, and CCA-ITQ to learn
the hash codes from the layer F7 features. These two-stage
(AlexNet ﬁne-tune+X) approaches serve as the baselines
compared in this experiment. To provide more insight into
the performance of the hash approaches, we also include
the results obtained by the Euclidean (l2) distance of the F7
features from the ﬁne-tuned AlexNet in the comparison. The
hash approaches are evaluated when the code length is 128.
Figure 8 shows the precision curves with respect to a
different number of top retrieved images and Table 5 shows
the mAP of the top 1,000 returned images. We compute the
mAP based on the top 1,000 images of a returned list rather
than the entire list due to the high computational cost in
mAP evaluation. It is interesting that the hash approaches,
except LSH, give better retrieval performance than a direct
match based on the Euclidean distance of the ﬁne-tuned
deep features. This shows that learning hash codes on
top of the deep features can improve the quantization in
the feature space and increase the retrieval performance.
The results also show that supervised hashing approaches
can better capture the semantic structure of the data than
unsupervised ones. Furthermore, SSDH gets more favorable
results than the two-stage approaches combining ﬁne-tuned
AlexNet features and conventional hash methods. We owe
this to an advantage of our approach that simultaneous
learning of the deep features and hash functions can achieve
better performance. About the classiﬁcation performance,
SSDH and ﬁne-tuned AlexNet get 73.27% and 71.86% accu-
racies, respectively.

4.8 Retrieval Results on UT-ZAP50K
UT-ZAP50K is a multi-label dataset consisting of shopping
images, which has not been used for retrieval performance
comparison yet. Similar to the experiments on Yahoo-1M,
we use deep features from ﬁne-tuned AlexNet for LSH, ITQ,
and CCA-ITQ to learn binary codes and also include the
performance of an exhaustive search based on the Euclidean
(l2) distance of the deep AlexNet features. The performance
is evaluated when the code length is 48.

In this experiment, we verify the relevance of the query
and returned images by examining whether they have
exactly the same labels. This is because when searching
shopping items, one may want the retrieved images not

only in the same category but also for the same gender to
the query. This criterion requires all relevant labels to be
retrieved for a query, which is stricter than that for the NUS-
WIDE dataset where the retrieval is considered correct if it
exhibits at least one common labels with the query.

Figure 9 shows the precision of various methods at top
k returned images. Under such a demanding evaluation cri-
terion, SSDH still produces better results than the compared
approaches for all k. Similar to the results of Yahoo-1M, the
hash-based approaches (AlexNet-FineTune+ITQ, AlexNet-
FineTune+CCA-ITQ, and ours) can yield effective quantiza-
tion spaces and get more favorable results than searching
with ﬁne-tuned AlexNet features in Euclidean space.

Like NUS-WIDE, we investigate the use of L1 margin
(p = 1) in the maximum-margin loss of Eq. (4) for this
multi-label dataset. When implemented with 48-bit codes,
SSDH produces a 65.94% mAP and a 62.08% precision@500
samples. These results are worse than the 71.91% mAP and
the 66.59% precision@500 samples of SSDH with L2 margin,
in accordance with the observations made on NUS-WIDE.
Hence, from these results, we suggest to use p = 2 in the
maximum-margin loss in Eq. (4) for multi-label learning.

4.9 Retrieval Results on ILSVRC2012
Thus far, the number of dataset labels having been han-
dled is around 10 to 100, except that SUN397 has approx-
imately 400 labels. In this experiment, we apply SSDH to
the ILSVRC2012 dataset that is large in both data amount
and number of labels to further demonstrate the scalability
of SSDH. We compare SSDH with the combinations of
AlexNet features and ITQ/CCA-ITQ because they perform
considerably better than AlexNet-FineTune+l2 and AlexNet-
FineTune+LSH on the Yahoo-1M and UT-ZAP50K datasets.
Since the AlexNet model (from CAFFE) has been pre-
trained on this dataset, we directly use the AlexNet features
extracted as the input for ITQ and CCA-ITQ. Besides, as
ITQ and CCA-ITQ require high memory usage for matrix
computation, only 100,000 samples are deployed for the sub-
space learning of them. For our SSDH, a 512-bit latent layer
is used and our SSDH is then ﬁne-tuned on ILSVRC2012.

The upper half of Table 6 shows the results. It appears
that SSDH constantly yields better performance, which con-
ﬁrms that SSDH is applicable to not only large datasets but
also the data of numerous and diverse labels.

4.10 Retrieval Using Different Networks
Our SSDH can be generally integrated with other networks.
In this section, we provide the retrieval results of SSDH with

VGG16 (conﬁguration D in [6]), aside from AlexNet. VGG16
is much deeper than AlexNet. It comprises 13 convolutional
layers followed by 2 fully connected and one output layers,
and small (e.g., 3 × 3) convolution ﬁlters are exploited. Like
the way of applying our SSDH to AlexNet, a latent layer is
added between the output layer and its previous layer in
VGG16 to realize our approach.

Table 7 shows the results on CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE,
Yahoo-1M, and ILSVRC2012. For the large-scale datasets,
Yahoo-1M and ILSVRC2012, we observe that VGG16 can
boost SSDH’s performance by an at least 8.8% higher mAP
Therefore, deeper networks can learn more effective bi-
nary representations from complex and large-scale data. For
small- (CIFAR-10) and medium-sized (NUS-WIDE) datasets,
SSDH with both networks attain similar performance, re-
ﬂecting that a less complex network should sufﬁce for han-
dling small-sized data. These results reveal that SSDH can
be established on different architectures for the applications
of different data sizes. In addition, the characteristic of its
capability of leveraging on existing networks also makes it
easily implementable and ﬂexible for practical use.
Network simpliﬁcation. To beneﬁt large-scale image search,
fast hash code computation is required. Thus, an interesting
question arises. Can other network conﬁgurations allow for
fast code computation and also provide comparable results?
To address this issue, we conduct experiments with two
more networks, VGG11 (conﬁguration A in [6]) and VGG-
Avg (of our own design), on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
• VGG11 [6] is similar to VGG16. They differ only in depth:
VGG11 has 11 layers (8 convolutional, 2 fully connected,
and one output layers), whereas VGG16 has 16 layers.

• VGG-Avg is modiﬁed from VGG16 by ourselves. It com-
prises the same 13 convolutional layers as VGG16, but
the fully-connected layers (with the output classiﬁcation
layer excluded) in VGG16 are replaced by an average
pooling layer. Because the last convolutional
layer of
VGG16 has 512 channels, the average pooling produces
a 512-dimensional feature vector. This vector is then
connected to a 48-bit latent layer followed by a ﬁnal
classiﬁcation layer in our SSDH. The design is inspired
by the counterpart of NIN [60] and the very new and
successful ResNet [61]. It decreases the number of net-
work parameters drastically — 89% out of the VGG16’s
134 M parameters are taken up by the fully connected
layers, while no parameters need to be learned for average
pooling. The model size of VGG-Avg (15 M) is even
smaller than that of VGG11 (129 M) and AlexNet (57 M) as
shown in Table 8, making it a cheaper network consuming
less resources. Because the average pooling preserves the
shift invariance of the convolutional layers, the extracted
features are still effective for classifying an entire image.

AlexNet are 88.40%, 92.69%, 90.75% and 91.45% on the
standard benchmark CIFAR-10, respectively, where VGG11
performs less favorably. We conjecture that fewer lay-
ers combined with small-sized ﬁlters limits its ability to
learn representative codes. VGG-Avg performs better than
VGG11 (though slightly worse than VGG16), revealing that
replacing the fully connected layers by average pooling
highly reduces the network complexity with only a little
drop on the retrieval performance.

4.11 Cross Domain and Label Learning
We now study the usage of SSDH in two aspects: (1) cross-
domain retrieval, i.e., trained on one dataset and applied to
another and (2) retrieval on datasets with missing labels.
Cross-domain instance-level retrieval. SSDH is a super-
vised hash method. It uses the image labels in the training
dataset (i.e., gallery) to learn compact binary codes. Each
image in the gallery is then given with a binary code that can
be pre-stored for fast retrieval. However, typical instance-
level datasets such as Paris and Oxford lack such semantic-
label annotations. Their image relevancies are mainly estab-
lished by near-duplicates.

We use our SSDH on these datasets to examine its ca-
pability in similarity-based image retrieval. The centerpiece
of SSDH is established on the idea that semantic label
classiﬁcation is driven by several latent binary attributes;
semantic labels are thus needed in SSDH training. To apply
SSDH to both datasets without labels, we follow the idea of
neural codes for image retrieval [15] that the SSDH network
is pre-trained on a related dataset with label supervision.
This pre-trained dataset, Landmarks [15], contains URLs of
270,000+ images. Following the given URLs, we were able to
download 214,141 images of 721 labels. The SSDH of VGG16
is used to learn a network model from the downloaded
dataset, where a 512-bit latent layer is used because of its
better performance on large-scale datasets. We then use the
network model to extract binary codes for Paris and Oxford
datasets without any further ﬁne-tuning.

The Paris and Oxford pose a challenge to instance-level
retrieval as the same object in different images may ap-
pear in distinct viewpoints and scales. Similarities between
images may thus be determined by some local patches.
To deal with this issue, we follow the spatial search [14]
approach, where the image relevance is established based
on our binary codes of local patches at multiple scales. The
distance between a local query patch and a gallery image
is deﬁned as the minimum among the Hamming distances
of that query and gallery patch pairs. Then, the average
Hamming distance of all query patches to the gallery is used
as the distance between the query and the gallery.

Table 9 compares our retrieval results with the others,
where we are one of the few providing results based on

Comparison of the instance-level retrieval performance (mAP (%)) of

SSDH with other approaches on the Paris and Oxford datasets.

binary hash codes for instance-level retrieval. Among the
other results, only the one in [62] is based on binary codes
of 512 bits; the rest rely on real-valued features of 256 [50],
512 [15], or higher than 4,096 [14], [63] dimensions, and
all methods take advantage of deep learning techniques.
For Paris that is a dataset with a moderate level of view-
point and scale changes, SSDH performs more favorably
against the other approaches. For Oxford that is a dataset
with stronger viewpoint and scale changes, SSDH performs
not the best but is still competitive. Nevertheless, SSDH
achieves the performance by using a more compact code
(512-bit) than the others that use real-valued codes. Com-
pared with the approach using binary codes of the same
length [62], SSDH still performs more favorably. The results
show that the models trained on a large dataset can be
applied to the tasks in a relevant domain. Besides, the
outcomes also reveal that the codes learned are applicable
to retrieval tasks in which visual similarity is the criterion to
determine the relevance between images.
Retrieval on datasets with missing labels. In this exper-
iment, we consider the setting that learning is performed
on a dataset with missing labels. We choose the multi-label
dataset, NUS-WIDE, for the evaluation. For each training
image with more than one label in NUS-WIDE, half of
its labels are randomly removed. In this way, about 55%
of the training images have 50% missing labels, and the
testing set remains the same with complete labels. To handle
the missing labels in the implementation, we treat them
as “don’t care” in CAFFE. That is, the missing labels do
not contribute to the error terms in the classiﬁcation layer
during training. SSDH of the code length 48 with the VGG16
model is used in this experiment.

The results are reported as follows. On the missing-labels
setting, SSDH still gets an mAP of 88.02%, only a slight drop
from the 88.97% of the complete-labels setting shown in
Table 7. This indicates that SSDH can learn effective models
from the cross-label information in a multi-label dataset, and
performs robustly under label missing.

4.12 Computational Time
One advantage that binary codes offer is faster code com-
parison. For instance, it takes about 51.83 µs to compute
the Euclidean distance of two 4096-d ﬂoating-point features
with a MATLAB implementation on a desktop with an Intel
Xeon 3.70 GHz CPU of 4 cores, yet comparing two 512-bit
(128-bit) binary codes takes only about 0.17 µs (0.04 µs).

4.13 Classiﬁcation Results on Various Datasets
In previous sections, we have depicted the classiﬁcation
performance of SSDH for the single-labeled datasets. In this

section, we present more classiﬁcation results on the bench-
mark datasets in Table 10. From the table, it is observed that
our approach yields comparable performance to the state-
of-the-art classiﬁcation accuracies. An interesting ﬁnding is
that our approach achieves close classiﬁcation accuracies
compared to the ﬁne-tuned AlexNet or VGG. In particular,
the performance is attained via a rather lower-dimensional
feature space (eg. a 48-, 128-, or 512-dimensional binary
feature space) that is more compact, while the AlexNet or
VGG feature is of 4096 dimension of real values. Because
the classiﬁcation task relies on the feature space learned, it
thus shows that our architecture can cast the input image
into a considerably lower-dimensional space with an ap-
proximate class separation capability for the same data. The
outcomes suggest that SSDH, a multi-purpose architecture
for retrieval and classiﬁcation, not only achieves promising
classiﬁcation performance when compared with the models
that are optimized for a classiﬁcation task, but also is bene-
ﬁcial to the retrieval task.

Some further remarks and discussions of the experimen-

tal results are given in Appendix A.

5 CONCLUSIONS
We have presented a supervised deep hashing model,
SSDH, that preserves the label semantics between images.
SSDH constructs hash functions as a latent layer between
the feature layer and the classiﬁcation layer in a network. By
optimizing an objective function deﬁned over classiﬁcation
error and desired criterion for binary codes, SSDH jointly

learn binary codes, features, and classiﬁcation. Such a net-
work design comes with several merits: (1) SSDH uniﬁes
retrieval and classiﬁcation in a single model; and (2) SSDH
is simple and is easily realized by a slight modiﬁcation of
an existing deep network for classiﬁcation; and (3) SSDH
is naturally scalable to large scale search. We have con-
ducted extensive experiments and have provided compar-
ative evaluation of SSDH with several state-of-the-arts on
many benchmarks with a wide range of image types. The
results have shown that SSDH achieves superior retrieval
performance and provides promising classiﬁcation results.

APPENDIX A
REMARK OF CLASSIFICATION RESULTS ON ILSVRC
In our experiments, the classiﬁcation accuracies of SSDH
and ﬁne-tuned models are computed using only the center
crop of a test image. To have a fair comparison, we report
the results of AlexNet and VGG on ILSVRC2012 based on
a single crop. Hence, there are discrepancies between our
reported results and the ones in [5], [6] that employ multiple
crops at test time.

In addition, because the top-5 accuracy is used to eval-
uate the algorithms in the ILSVRC competition, we report
this accuracy for ILSVRC in Table 10 as well.

It is worth noting that adding the latent layers does
not necessarily reduce the classiﬁcation accuracies. We owe
this to the following reason. The added latent layer can
also be interpreted as a dimension-reduction layer from the
4096-dimensional feature layer in AlexNet or VGG. Adding
such a dimension-reduction layer is likely to remove the
redundancy and achieve further performance gains for clas-
siﬁcation even when the latent layer outputs are restricted
to be binary.
