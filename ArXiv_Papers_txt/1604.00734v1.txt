Abstract

A key challenge in entity linking is making ef-
fective use of contextual information to dis-
ambiguate mentions that might refer to differ-
ent entities in different contexts. We present
a model that uses convolutional neural net-
works to capture semantic correspondence be-
tween a mention’s context and a proposed tar-
get entity. These convolutional networks oper-
ate at multiple granularities to exploit various
kinds of topic information, and their rich pa-
rameterization gives them the capacity to learn
which n-grams characterize different topics.
We combine these networks with a sparse lin-
ear model to achieve state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on multiple entity linking datasets, out-
performing the prior systems of Durrett and
Klein (2014) and Nguyen et al. (2014).1

Introduction

1
One of the major challenges of entity linking is re-
solving contextually polysemous mentions. For ex-
ample, Germany may refer to a nation, to that na-
tion’s government, or even to a soccer team. Past
approaches to such cases have often focused on col-
lective entity linking: nearby mentions in a docu-
ment might be expected to link to topically-similar
entities, which can give us clues about the identity of
the mention currently being resolved (Ratinov et al.,
2011; Hoffart et al., 2011; He et al., 2013; Cheng
and Roth, 2013; Durrett and Klein, 2014). But an
even simpler approach is to use context information
from just the words in the source document itself to
make sure the entity is being resolved sensibly in
context. In past work, these approaches have typi-
cally relied on heuristics such as tf-idf (Ratinov et

1Source available at

github.com/matthewfl/nlp-entity-convnet

al., 2011), but such heuristics are hard to calibrate
and they capture structure in a coarser way than
learning-based methods.

In this work, we model semantic similarity be-
tween a mention’s source document context and its
potential entity targets using convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). CNNs have been shown to be ef-
fective for sentence classiﬁcation tasks (Kalchbren-
ner et al., 2014; Kim, 2014; Iyyer et al., 2015) and
for capturing similarity in models for entity linking
(Sun et al., 2015) and other related tasks (Dong et
al., 2015; Shen et al., 2014), so we expect them to be
effective at isolating the relevant topic semantics for
entity linking. We show that convolutions over mul-
tiple granularities of the input document are useful
for providing different notions of semantic context.
Finally, we show how to integrate these networks
with a preexisting entity linking system (Durrett and
Klein, 2014). Through a combination of these two
distinct methods into a single system that leverages
their complementary strengths, we achieve state-of-
the-art performance across several datasets.
2 Model
Our model focuses on two core ideas: ﬁrst, that topic
semantics at different granularities in a document
are helpful in determining the genres of entities for
entity linking, and second, that CNNs can distill a
block of text into a meaningful topic vector.

Our entity linking model is a log-linear model
that places distributions over target entities t given
a mention x and its containing source document.
For now, we take P (t|x) ∝ exp w(cid:62)fC(x, t; θ),
where fC produces a vector of features based on
CNNs with parameters θ as discussed in Section 2.1.
Section 2.2 describes how we combine this simple
model with a full-ﬂedged entity linking system. As
shown in the middle of Figure 1, each feature in fC

Figure 1: Extraction of convolutional vector space features fC (x, te). Three types of information from the input document and two
types of information from the proposed title are fed through convolutional networks to produce vectors, which are systematically
compared with cosine similarity to derive real-valued semantic similarity features.

is a cosine similarity between a topic vector asso-
ciated with the source document and a topic vector
associated with the target entity. These vectors are
computed by distinct CNNs operating over different
subsets of relevant text.

Figure 1 shows an example of why different kinds
of context are important for entity linking. In this
case, we are considering whether Pink Floyd might
link to the article Gavin Floyd on Wikipedia
(imagine that Pink Floyd might be a person’s nick-
name). If we look at the source document, we see
that the immediate source document context around
the mention Pink Floyd is referring to rock groups
(Led Zeppelin, Van Halen) and the target entity’s
Wikipedia page is primarily about sports (baseball
starting pitcher). Distilling these texts into succinct
topic descriptors and then comparing those helps tell
us that this is an improbable entity link pair.
In
this case, the broader source document context actu-
ally does not help very much, since it contains other
generic last names like Campbell and Savage that
might not necessarily indicate the document to be
in the music genre. However, in general, the whole
document might provide a more robust topic esti-
mate than a small context window does.

2.1 Convolutional Semantic Similarity

Figure 1 shows our method for computing topic vec-
tors and using those to extract features for a potential
Wikipedia link. For each of three text granularities

in the source document (the mention, that mention’s
immediate context, and the entire document) and
two text granularities on the target entity side (title
and Wikipedia article text), we produce vector rep-
resentations with CNNs as follows. We ﬁrst embed
each word into a d-dimensional vector space using
standard embedding techniques (discussed in Sec-
tion 3.2), yielding a sequence of vectors w1, . . . , wn.
We then map those words into a ﬁxed-size vector
using a convolutional network parameterized with a

ﬁlter bank M ∈ Rk×d(cid:96). We put the result through a

rectiﬁed linear unit (ReLU) and combine the results
with sum pooling, giving the following formulation:

convg(w1:n) =

n−(cid:96)(cid:88)j=1

max{0, Mgwj:j+(cid:96)}

(1)

where wj:j+(cid:96) is a concatenation of the given word
vectors and the max is element-wise.2 Each con-
volution granularity (mention, context, etc.) has a
distinct set of ﬁlter parameters Mg.

This process produces multiple representative
topic vectors sment, scontext, and sdoc for the source
document and ttitle and tdoc for the target entity, as
shown in Figure 1. All pairs of these vectors be-
tween the source and the target are then compared
using cosine similarity, as shown in the middle of
Figure 1. This yields the vector of features fC(s, te)

2For all experiments, we set (cid:96) = 5 and k = 150.

vector can then be combined with other sparse fea-
tures and fed into a ﬁnal logistic regression layer
(maintaining end-to-end inference and learning of
the ﬁlters). When trained with backpropagation, the
convolutional networks should learn to map text into
vector spaces that are informative about whether the
document and entity are related or not.

Integrating with a Sparse Model

2.2
The dense model presented in Section 2.1 is effec-
tive at capturing semantic topic similarity, but it is
most effective when combined with other signals
for entity linking. An important cue for resolving
a mention is the use of link counts from hyperlinks
in Wikipedia (Cucerzan, 2007; Milne and Witten,
2008; Ji and Grishman, 2011), which tell us how
often a given mention was linked to each article on
Wikipedia. This information can serve as a useful
prior, but only if we can leverage it effectively by tar-
geting the most salient part of a mention. For exam-
ple, we may have never observed President Barack
Obama as a linked string on Wikipedia, even though
we have seen the substring Barack Obama and it un-
ambiguously indicates the correct answer.

Following Durrett and Klein (2014), we introduce
a latent variable q to capture which subset of a men-
tion (known as a query) we resolve. Query gen-
eration includes potentially removing stop words,
plural sufﬁxes, punctuation, and leading or tail-
ing words. This processes generates on average 9
queries for each mention. Conveniently, this set of
queries also deﬁnes the set of candidate entities that
we consider linking a mention to: each query gener-
ates a set of potential entities based on link counts,
whose unions are then taken to give on the possible
entity targets for each mention (including the null
link). In the example shown in Figure 1, the query
phrases are Pink Floyd and Floyd, which generate
Pink Floyd and Gavin Floyd as potential link
targets (among other options that might be derived
from the Floyd query).

linear way with three separate components:

Our ﬁnal model has the form P (t|x) =
(cid:80)q P (t, q|x). We parameterize P (t, q|x) in a log-
P (t, q|x) ∝ exp(cid:0)w(cid:62)(fQ(x, q) + fE(x, q, t) + fC(x, t; θ))(cid:1)

fQ and fE are both sparse features vectors and are

taken from previous work (Durrett and Klein, 2014).
fC is as discussed in Section 2.1. Note that fC has
its own internal parameters θ because it relies on
CNNs with learned ﬁlters; however, we can compute
gradients for these parameters with standard back-
propagation. The whole model is trained to maxi-
mize the log likelihood of a labeled training corpus
using Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012).

The indicator features fQ and fE are described in
more detail in Durrett and Klein (2014). fQ only
impacts which query is selected and not the disam-
biguation to a title. It is designed to roughly cap-
ture the basic shape of a query to measure its de-
sirability, indicating whether sufﬁxes were removed
and whether the query captures the capitalized sub-
sequence of a mention, as well as standard lexical,
POS, and named entity type features. fE mostly
captures how likely the selected query is to corre-
spond to a given entity based on factors like an-
chor text counts from Wikipedia, string match with
proposed Wikipedia titles, and discretized cosine
similarities of tf-idf vectors (Ratinov et al., 2011).
Adding tf-idf indicators is the only modiﬁcation we
made to the features of Durrett and Klein (2014).

3 Experimental Results
We performed experiments on 4 different entity link-
ing datasets.

• ACE (NIST, 2005; Bentivogli et al., 2010):
This corpus was used in Fahrni and Strube
(2014) and Durrett and Klein (2014).
• CoNLL-YAGO (Hoffart et al., 2011): This cor-
pus is based on the CoNLL 2003 dataset; the
test set consists of 231 news articles and con-
tains a number of rarer entities.
• WP (Heath and Bizer, 2011): This dataset con-
sists of short snippets from Wikipedia.
This
• Wikipedia (Ratinov et al., 2011):
dataset consists of 10,000 randomly sampled
Wikipedia articles, with the task being to re-
solve the links in each article.3

3We do not compare to Ratinov et al. (2011) on this dataset
because we do not have access to the original Wikipedia dump
they used for their work and as a result could not duplicate their
results or conduct comparable experiments, a problem which
was also noted by Nguyen et al. (2014).

Our results outperform those of Durrett and Klein (2014) and
Nguyen et al. (2014). In general, we also see that the convolu-
tional networks by themselves can outperform the system using
only sparse features, and in all cases these stack to give substan-
tial beneﬁt.

We use standard train-test splits for all datasets ex-
cept for WP, where no standard split is available.
In this case, we randomly sample a test set. For
all experiments, we use word vectors computed by
running word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) on all
Wikipedia, as described in Section 3.2.

Table 2 shows results for two baselines and three
variants of our system. Our main contribution is
the combination of indicator features and CNN fea-
tures (Full). We see that this system outperforms the
results of Durrett and Klein (2014) and the AIDA-
LIGHT system of Nguyen et al. (2014). We can
also compare to two ablations: using just the sparse
features (a system which is a direct extension of
Durrett and Klein (2014)) or using just the CNN-
derived features.5 Our CNN features generally out-
perform the sparse features and improve even further
when stacked with them. This reﬂects that they cap-
ture orthogonal sources of information: for example,
the sparse features can capture how frequently the
target document was linked to, whereas the CNNs
can capture document context in a more nuanced
way. These CNN features also clearly supersede
the sparse features based on tf-idf (taken from (Rati-
nov et al., 2011)), showing that indeed that CNNs
are better at learning semantic topic similarity than
heuristics like tf-idf.

4The test set for this dataset is only 40 out of 10,000 docu-

ments and subject to wide variation in performance.

5In this model, the set of possible link targets for each
mention is still populated using anchor text information from
Wikipedia (Section 2.2), but note that link counts are not used
as a feature here.

Table 3: Comparison of using only topic information derived
from the document and target article, only information derived
from the mention itself and the target entity title, and the full
set of information (six features, as shown in Figure 1). Nei-
ther the ﬁnest nor coarsest convolutional context can give the
performance of the complete set. Numbers are reported on a
development set.

In the sparse feature system, the highest weighted
features are typically those indicating the frequency
that a page was linked to and those indicating spe-
ciﬁc lexical items in the choice of the latent query
variable q. This suggests that the system of Dur-
rett and Klein (2014) has the power to pick the right
span of a mention to resolve, but then is left to gener-
ally pick the most common link target in Wikipedia,
which is not always correct. By contrast, the full
system has a greater ability to pick less common
link targets if the topic indicators distilled from the
CNNs indicate that it should do so.

3.1 Multiple Granularities of Convolution
One question we might ask is how much we gain by
having multiple convolutions on the source and tar-
get side. Table 3 compares our full suite of CNN
features, i.e. the six features speciﬁed in Figure 1,
with two speciﬁc convolutional features in isola-
tion. Using convolutions over just the source doc-
ument (sdoc) and target article text (tdoc) gives a
system6 that performs, in aggregate, comparably to
using convolutions over just the mention (sment)
and the entity title (ttitle). These represent two
extremes of the system: consuming the maximum
amount of context, which might give the most ro-
bust representation of topic semantics, and consum-
ing the minimum amount of context, which gives
the most focused representation of topics seman-
tics (and which more generally might allow the sys-
tem to directly memorize train-test pairs observed
in training). However, neither performs as well as
the combination of all CNN features, showing that
the different granularities capture complementary

in Sun et al. (2015).

vs. Wikipedia on development sets for each corpus.

3.2 Embedding Vectors
We also explored two different sources of embed-
ding vectors for the convolutions. Table 4 shows that
word vectors trained on Wikipedia outperformed
Google News word vectors trained on a larger cor-
pus. Further investigation revealed that the Google
News vectors had much higher out-of-vocabulary
rates. For learning the vectors, we use the standard
word2vec toolkit (Mikolov et al., 2013) with vector
length set to 300, window set to 21 (larger windows
produce more semantically-focused vectors (Levy
and Goldberg, 2014)), 10 negative samples and 10
iterations through Wikipedia. We do not ﬁne-tune
word vectors during training of our model, as that
was not found to improve performance.

3.3 Analysis of Learned Convolutions
One downside of our system compared to its purely
indicator-based variant is that its operation is less in-
terpretable. However, one way we can inspect the
learned system is by examining what causes high ac-
tivations of the various convolutional ﬁlters (rows of
the matrices Mg from Equation 1). Table 1 shows
the n-grams in the ACE dataset leading to maximal

activations of three of the ﬁlters from Mdoc. Some
ﬁlters tend to learn to pick up on n-grams character-
istic of a particular topic. In other cases, a single ﬁl-
ter might be somewhat inscrutable, as with the third
column of Table 1. There are a few possible explana-
tions for this. First, the ﬁlter may generally have low
activations and therefore have little impact in the ﬁ-
nal feature computation. Second, the extreme points
of the ﬁlter may not be characteristic of its overall
behavior, since the bulk of n-grams will lead to more
moderate activations. Finally, such a ﬁlter may rep-
resent the superposition of a few topics that we are
unlikely to ever need to disambiguate between; in
a particular context, this ﬁlter will then play a clear
role, but one which is hard to determine from the
overall shape of the parameters.

4 Conclusion

In this work, we investigated using convolutional
networks to capture semantic similarity between
source documents and potential entity link targets.
Using multiple granularities of convolutions to eval-
uate the compatibility of a mention in context and
several potential link targets gives strong perfor-
mance on its own; moreover, such features also im-
prove a pre-existing entity linking system based on
sparse indicator features, showing that these sources
of information are complementary.
